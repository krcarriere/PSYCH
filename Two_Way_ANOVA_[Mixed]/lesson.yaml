#1
- Class: text
  Output: "In the last class, we talked about a Two Way ANOVA with both factors being 'between' people, in the sense that everyone was given a single group. Boys vs. girls, or in our case, were they travelling east or west, and what station they were at. You can't be at two stations at the same time."
#2
- Class: text
  Output: "But, we can do experiments in many ways. Consider your knowledge of statistics before you took this class. Then, you take this class. Your knowledge has hopefully increased since we gave you this 'treatment' - the class itself!"
#3
- Class: text
  Output: "Perhaps even more clear, imagine how you feel before and after taking medicine. You are experimenting on yourself. You have your feelings at Time 1 (before you take the drug), and then you have your feelings at Time 2 (after you take the drugs). You can imagine we could make a lot of these - Time before, time 1 hour after, 6 hours after, 12 days after... Time is an important within-subjects factor, and can be many levels!"
#4
- Class: text
  Output: "What are the benefits of this kind of experiment?"
#5
- Class: text
  Output: "Well, for one, consider the problem with psychology. We try to keep things as random as possible so we can attribute changes due to the experiment. But people are different! Things can effect people in different ways beyond our control."
#6
- Class: text
  Output: "But you - you before, and after this test - are still the same person. The only thing that changed for you was this test! That is the power of within-subjects. The groups we create are the same people studied many times."
#7
- Class: text
  Output: "That also shows the second point of within subjects. While for Between, we need a group who took the test, and a group who did not take the test, for within, we only need a single group, and test them before and after taking the test."

  Output: "Today, we will be looking at another dataset. In this study (Study 3), individuals who had partners were asked to write about their day with their partner on Feb. 8th. Then, a week later, they were asked to write about their day on the 14th (Valentine's Day). The researchers classified as these days as extraordinary (Valentine's Day) and ordinary (February 8th). Both times they rated how curious they would be to read what they wrote at a later date. Three months later, half of participants read the extraordinary event, and half read the ordinary event. They again rated how curious they were to read what they wrote. \n\nFor the full citation, see Zhang, T., Kim, T., Brooks, A.W., Gino, F., & Norton, M. I. (2014).

#9
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "This is what we call a Mixed-Design, where one of our factors is Within-Subjects and one is Between. Which independent variable was Within-Subjects?"
  AnswerChoices: Whether they read the extraordinary or ordinary event at time 2; Whether they wrote about the extraordinary or ordinary event at time 1; Time (1 and 2); Whether they were in a relationship or not
  CorrectAnswer: Time (1 and 2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Time (1 and 2)')
  Hint: What was each participant exposed to?
#10
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Which one of the variables was the between subjects variable?"
  AnswerChoices: Whether they read the extraordinary or ordinary event at time 2; Whether they wrote about the extraordinary or ordinary event at time 1; Time (1 and 2); Whether they were in a relationship or not
  CorrectAnswer: Whether they read the extraordinary or ordinary event at time 2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Whether they read the extraordinary or ordinary event at time 2')
  Hint: Which one talks about only half of the participants doing x?
#11
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In the Between Subjects class, we focused on ggplot a lot. Today, I want to walk through more of the analytical side of ANOVAs. Check the top six rows by calling head(data). 
  CorrectAnswer: head(data)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='head(data)')
  Hint: head(data)
#12
- Class: text
  Output: "We can see that ParticipantID is shown 1, 1, 2, 2.. etc. That is because each observation is given its own row. This is an important part of clean data! We also see we have the age of the participant, the gender, how extraordinary they rated the event, and how curious they were to read about the event."
#13
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now, we're going to run our first model. In R, mixed effects are a bit harder. We want to save our ANOVA as a new variable, model. in model, we will use the function aov(). We'll pass two arguments to aov(). The first is data, which we'll set equal to data. The second is the equation. The first part of the equation you should hopefully remember from last class. We write it as DV ~ IV*IV. Our DV is Curiousity, and our IVs are Condition and time. After we write Condition*time, we want to add (+) one more thing, which is Error(participantid/time). This let's R know that we're doing within subjects, that the within subjects variable is time, and that it is repeated for each participant."
  CorrectAnswer: model <- aov(data=data, Curiousity ~ Condition * time + Error(participantid/time))
  AnswerTests: expr_creates_var('model'); omnitest(correctExpr='model <- aov(data=data, Curiousity ~ Condition * time + Error(participantid/time))')
  Hint: model <- aov(data=data, Curiousity ~ Condition * time + Error(participantid/time))
#14
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Great job. Now, let's use the summary() function, and pass in model into it."
  CorrectAnswer: summary(model)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(model)')
  Hint: 
#15
- Class: text
  Output: "In this, we can see R broke up our results. The top one is our between subjects results - Condition. The bottom is our Within Subjects ANOVA - things that happened within each person. That would be time, and the interaction of time and condition."

#16
- Class: text
  Output: "Let's look more closely at the bottom ANOVA. We can see there are the following columns. Df, Sum Sq, Mean Sq, F value, and PR(>F)."
#17
- Class: text
  Output: "The rows are time, Condition:time, and Residuals. Residuals mean everything else that isn't explained by our conditions and time."
#18
- Class: text
  Output: "But where did they get these numbers? In class, we'll discuss how to calculate Sum of Squares. But, an ANOVA table is just like doing math straight across."
#19
- Class: text
  Output: "To get Mean Sq, we take Sum Sq and divide by Df of that row. This ANOVA is a bit hard, because 7.45/1=7.45 (rounding errors), and 6.37/1=6.37. But, look at Residuals."
#20
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Without doing any calculation, what is 159.19/128?"
  AnswerChoices: 7.446; 6.365; 1.244;.0158; 1.356
  CorrectAnswer: 1.244
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1.244')
  Hint: Look at Residuals Sum of Sq and Residuals Df. If Mean Sq is Sum Sq/Df, then...?
#21
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Exactly. To get a better understanding of this, I've created a similar dataset. Press up a few times to get back to our equation. Save it second_model, and change data=data to data=extended_data."
  CorrectAnswer: second_model <- aov(Curiousity ~ Condition * time + Error(participantid/time), data=extended_data)
  AnswerTests: expr_creates_var('second_model'); omnitest(correctExpr='second_model <- aov(data=extended_data, Curiousity ~ Condition * time + Error(participantid/time))')
  Hint: second_model <- aov(data=extended_data, Curiousity ~ Condition * time + Error(participantid/time))
#22
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Great job. Now, let's use the summary() function, and pass in second_model into it."
  CorrectAnswer: summary(second_model)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(second_model)')
  Hint: 
#23
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Great job. Now, look at time in the Within Subject part of the ANOVA. df=2, Sum Sq = 9.93. Type 9.93/2 into the console now and hit enter. "
  CorrectAnswer: 9.93/2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='9.93/2')
#24
- Class: text
  Output: "Exactly! And look at Mean Sq of time. 4.964 is very close to 4.965."
#25
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Great job. Let's look at the results of the real experiment by typing graph."
  CorrectAnswer: graph
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='graph')
#26
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Which statement is true about the results? Think both by the graph and by the results from summary(model)."
  AnswerChoices: There is a difference in curiousity between ordinary and extraordinary experiences in Time 2; There is a difference in curiousity between ordinary and extraordinary experiences overall; There is an interaction effect, such that while there is a significant difference at Time 1, when the time comes in Time 2, there is no true difference in our curiousity.;
  CorrectAnswer: There is an interaction effect, such that while there is a significant difference at Time 1, when the time comes in Time 2, there is no true difference in our curiousity.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='There is an interaction effect, such that while there is a significant difference at Time 1, when the time comes in Time 2, there is no true difference in our curiousity.')
#27
- Class: text
  Output: "Exactly! What this result shows us is that while in the moment, we think of special days as special, in the future, every day is just as interesting, it doesn't matter if it was special or not."
