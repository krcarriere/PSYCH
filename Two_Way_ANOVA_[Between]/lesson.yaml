- Class: text
  Output: Today, we will go over Factorial ANOVAs when all factors are between subjects; there can only be one observation per combination of conditions.

- Class: text
  Output: This module will give an example of a 2x4 and a 2x2, but the same logic and code would equally apply to a 2x2x2 and other designs.
  
- Class: text
  Output: To do that, we will look at two studies and replicate some of their results.
#5
- Class: text
  Output: The first paper has a study that is extremely easy to replicate! They approached people on a train track and asked them a single question.

  Output: "The citation is - Maglio, S. J., & Polman, E. (2014). Spatial orientation shrinks and expands psychological distance. Psychological Science. 25(7). 1345-1352."

- Class: text
  Output: "As mentioned, researchers went to a train track. They recruited 100 participants on the Eastbound track and 100 on the Westbound track. They were randomly assigned to rate how far away they felt a stop was. The stop under question was one or two stops ahead or behind them (So, either one stop ahead, two stops ahead, one stop behind, two stops behind, where behind/ahead depends on direction they were headed)."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Importantly, the distance from 2-1-0-1-2 was equidistance in reality. The research question was this - do people subjectively feel that their destination is closer or further away than where they are coming from (behind them)? \n\n We've loaded their dataset, called data. Check data by piping (|>) the data into summary()."
  CorrectAnswer: data |> summary()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data |> summary()')
  Hint: data |> summary()


- Class: text
  Output: "Great job! The first variable is orientation, with N=101 Eastbound and N=101 Westbound.  \n\n The second variable is called station. This is one of four station names the researchers asked participants about. \n\n Finally, there is a rating of subjective distance."   

#10
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The first thing we should check is if the data is balanced (That there are an equal number of observations per cell). By the summary alone, we can tell that it won't be because there are odd numbers in the levels of both factors. Let's take data and pipe (|>) it into select(), where we can list our two-factor variables (orientation and station), and then pipe (|>) that into table(). 
  CorrectAnswer: data |> select(orientation, station) |> table()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data |> select(orientation, station) |> table()')
  Hint: data |> select(orientation, station) |> table()

- Class: text
  Output: Great job. The data is unbalanced. This is an essential and frequently overlooked problem with ANOVAs. While ANOVAs will report the same results if factors are balanced, there are small but essential differences if our factors are unbalanced (and the more unbalanced, the more differences!). We show this in the Notes with a complete example. 

- Class: text
  Output: The quick and dirty takeaway that we will operate under is that if running an ANOVA with an interaction effect and unbalanced groups in your model, you should report Type II sum of squares if the interaction is non-significant and Type III sum of squares if the interaction is significant.

  Output: These citations are also in the notes.

- Class: text
  Output: "The authors write - We carried out a 2 (orientation: toward, away from) × 4 (station: Spadina, St. George, Bloor-Yonge, Sherbourne) analysis of variance  (ANOVA) on closeness ratings, which revealed no main effect of orientation, F < 1, and a main effect of station, F(3, 194) = 24.10, p < .001,  partial eta sq = .27. \n\n  This main effect was qualified by the predicted interaction between orientation and station, F(3, 194) = 16.28, p < .001, partial eta sq = .20."

  Output: Now, let us run our ANOVA. To do so, take our data (data) and pipe (|>) it into the anova_test() function in the rstatix package. It will take three arguments - the first the formula, which we want to predict subjective_distance by (~) the interaction (*) of orientation and station. Instead of adding (+) these factors, we use * to symbolize their interaction. We will also pass a second argument stating that type=3. Finally, our last argument, effect.size, should be set equal to 'pes' for partial eta squared. Try that now.
  CorrectAnswer: data |> anova_test(subjective_distance ~ orientation * station, type = 3, effect.size='pes')
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data |> anova_test(subjective_distance ~ orientation * station, type = 3, effect.size="pes")')
  Hint: "data |> anova_test(subjective_distance ~ orientation * station, type = 3, effect.size='pes')"
  
- Class: text
  Output: What we like about anova_test() is that it gives us all of the information reported in one go and allows us to call out the type of sum of squares explicitly. 

- Class: figure
  Output: We plot the results here (you'll probably need to readjust your plot window to see it) to best replicate their Figure from the paper. A fun fact - the note in their paper states that the bars represent +/- 1 standard error. However, to replicate it, we need to plot +/- 1.96 standard errors! 
  Figure: Figure1.R
  FigureType: New

- Class: text
  Output: Looking at the graph, what they want to see is whether or not, for example, "Distance from Spadina" is different based on where you are going - Westbound or Eastbound. Each 'stop' needs to be compared - remember, they're all at the same place and simply going in opposite directions! The interaction was significant, so we know that the station's effect depends on the effect of orientation. But which ones?

- Class: text 
  Output: We're going to test these differences by using planned comparisons. Planned comparisons are a specific type of post-hoc test when we have specific, a priori comparisons that we want to make. Here, we know before running the study, the comparisons we care about are the group differences at each station. This is especially important for this study - with eight different groups totaling 28 possible comparisons!
#20
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We're going to take this in three steps. First, we need to rewrite our analysis. Instead of using anova_test(), we are going to pipe our data (data) to lm(). It will take two arguments, our formula (subjective_distance ~ orientation*station) and that data=_. After that, we will pipe that result into the emmeans() function from the emmeans library and pass that a single argument, ~orientation*station. 
  CorrectAnswer: data |> lm(subjective_distance ~ orientation*station, data=_) |> emmeans(~orientation*station) 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data |> lm(subjective_distance ~ orientation*station, data=_) |> emmeans(~orientation*station) ')
  Hint: data |> lm(subjective_distance ~ orientation*station, data=_) |> emmeans(~orientation*station) 

#21
- Class: script
  Output: Great job. That got us a list of the eight groups and their estimated marginal means (emmean). Now, if you were to count down, you could count 1, 2, 3... to Westbound Sherbourne being 8.  We've opened up a script for the second part, where we must declare what we want to compare. Be sure to save your work, and then type submit().
  AnswerTests: script_results_identical('Contrast_List')
  Hint: Try skip() if you can't get it, and look to see how the answer looks.
  Script: script1.R
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now that we have the Contrast_List built correctly, let's hit up on our keyboard until we get to the function call that provided those emmeans() (starting by piping our data and ending with emmeans(~orientation*station)). At this point, we want to pipe one more thing in. So, take that and pipe (|>) the contrast() function from emmeans, which will take two arguments, Contrast_List, and adjust="sidak".
  CorrectAnswer: data |> lm(subjective_distance ~ orientation*station, data=_) |> emmeans(~orientation*station) |> contrast(Contrast_List, adjust="sidak")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data |> lm(subjective_distance ~ orientation*station, data=_) |> emmeans(~orientation*station) |> contrast(Contrast_List, adjust="sidak")')
  Hint: data |> lm(subjective_distance ~ orientation*station, data=_) |> emmeans(~orientation*station) |> contrast(Contrast_List, adjust="sidak")

  Output: Great, let's move onto our second study now.
  
- Class: text
  Output: "The authors wished to replicate results originally found in previous research. The study design is a 2 ('time is money' mindset vs. control mindset) by 2 (additional compensation received vs. no additional compensation received) between-subjects factorial design. Participants in the Time/Money condition completed a calculation task that involved determining their hourly wage starting from their annual income to activate a 'time is money' mindset. In the control condition, the calculation task consisted of multiplying together random 5-digit numbers. Participants were informed that they would be paid an additional $0.50 for listening to a music track in the compensation condition. In contrast, those in the non-compensation condition were not offered this extra monetary incentive."

Time, money, and happiness- Does putting a price on time affect our ability to smell the roses? Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 67, 60-64. doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2015.08.005
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's look at the data by piping our dataset, buyhappy, into head().
  CorrectAnswer: buyhappy |> head()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='buyhappy |> head()')
  Hint: buyhappy |> head()
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's first check if we have a balanced design. Remember, to do that, take our data, buyhappy, and pipe it into select, where we'll select the two variables, Comp and Mindset, and then pass that through table().
  CorrectAnswer: buyhappy |> select(Comp, Mindset) |> table()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='buyhappy |> select(Comp, Mindset) |> table()')
  Hint: buyhappy |> select(Comp, Mindset) |> table()
  
- Class: text
  Output: Oooh, not balanced. Okay, so we will need to pay attention to the type of sum of squares again.
  #29
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let us pipe (|>) our dataset, buyhappy, into anova_test(), where we will try and predict an individual's Happiness scores by (~) the interaction of Comp and Mindset and set the second argument of type equal to 3. 
  CorrectAnswer: buyhappy |> anova_test(Happiness ~ Comp*Mindset, type=3)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='buyhappy |> anova_test(Happiness ~ Comp*Mindset, type=3)')
  Hint: Try buyhappy |> anova_test(Happiness ~ Comp*Mindset, type=3) 

- Class: text
  Output: Great. Now, the authors write - "the nature of this interaction was contrary to that obtained by DeVoe and House. Simple effects analyses revealed that this interaction was driven by differences in compensation received in the control condition rather than the time/money condition. Specifically, participants who performed meaningless calculations reported greater enjoyment when explicitly compensated for listening to the music (M = 73.94, SD = 18.51) than when not compensated (M = 63.64, SD = 27.72). In contrast, participants who calculated their hourly wage did not differ in enjoyment scores from the music whether explicitly compensated to listen to it (M = 66.59, SD = 22.37) or not (M = 72.38, SD = 20.17), p = .150"
  
- Class: text
  Output: Let us assume they do not know where these differences lie. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To make posthoc comparisons, where we want to test every combination, we will pass our data, buyhappy, and then (|>) use the lm() function with two arguments, Happiness ~ Comp*Mindset and data=_ , and then |> we will pass it the emmeans() function from the emmeans library with the single argument ~Comp*Mindset , and then (|>) we will call the last function, pairs(). Do that now.
  CorrectAnswer: buyhappy |> lm(Happiness ~ Comp*Mindset, data=_) |> emmeans(~Comp*Mindset) |> pairs()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='buyhappy |> lm(Happiness ~ Comp*Mindset, data=_) |> emmeans(~Comp*Mindset) |> pairs()')
  Hint: buyhappy |> lm(Happiness ~ Comp*Mindset, data=_) |> emmeans(~Comp*Mindset) |> pairs()
  
- Class: script
  Output: Let's practice summarising our data by our groups to get the means and standard deviations they reported. When you have finished the script, save and type submit().
  AnswerTests: script_results_identical('sumdata')
