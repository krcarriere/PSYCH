#2
- Class: text
  Output: In this module, we will focus on how to create violin plots. Violin plots are a great base layer to stack more information on top of. 
#3

- Class: text
  Output: Violin plots show the distribution of the variable. It tells us a lot about the variable itself. Still, it can also visually check if variances between groups are plausibly equal and if the response variable within groups looks normally distributed. 
#4
- Class: figure
  Output: For example, this graph shows the violin plot graphed behind a boxplot so that the viewer sees not only the distribution but also the median, first and third quartiles, the IQR, and any outliers.

#5
- Class: figure
  Output: This figure uses half of a violin plot (from the PupillometryR package) to create what has been called a Raincloud plot.
  Figure: Figure2.R
  FigureType: New
#6
- Class: figure
  Output: Finally, this violin plot plots the mean as a reference point within the distribution.

  #7
- Class: text
  Output: We will talk through a lot of modifications as well that you can make. Remember, you can always play independently with play(), but follow our instructions while learning here.
#8

- Class: figure
  Output: In this module, we will (almost) perfectly replicate Figure 1 in Nalborczyk (2022). The notes will have the complete solution with adding one more package, but for educational purposes, we will default to a more fundamental layer (geom_jitter instead of geom_quasirandom).

  Output: "The full citation for this figure is Nalborczyk, L. (2022). Re-analysing the Data From Moffatt et al. (2020) - What Can We Learn From an Under-powered Absence of Difference? Collabra: Psychology, 8(1), 33059. doi.org/10.1525/collabra.33059"

#10 
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's start by looking at the data leading to this figure. Pipe (|>) Violin into head(10).
  CorrectAnswer: Violin |> head(10)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Violin |> head(10)')
  Hint: Violin |> head(10)
  
#11
- Class: text
  Output: For this graph, we don't want to talk about what the variables mean but instead grapple with visualizing data without knowing what things stand for. We can see there are four columns. One, ID, seems to represent participant ID. Since it's repeated, we can tell that this data is in the long format and that there are many observations per participant. How many observations? 9 (note the change to 103 at 10). Looking at the following two columns, this suggests that each variable probably has three levels (for nine conditions per participant). Then, there is a single numeric variable. Since there's only one numeric variable, we know that will go on our y-axis. We can also see that BAS, DIS, and RUM are on the x-axis, which we can identify as the variable condition in our data. 

#12
- Class: text
  Output: Since a violin plot graphs distributions, we probably need to give it all our data. Unlike grouped bar plots, which graphs means, grouped bar plots can do well with just being given summarised data.

#13
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's start by setting up our ggplot space. Take your dataset, Violin, and pipe (|>) it into ggplot(). ggplot() will take one argument. The argument, aes(), is a function that will take two arguments. aes() stands for aesthetics - what do we want our plot to look like? Well, we want the x-axis (x) to be (=) condition, and we want the y-axis (y) to be (=) value. After we close that off, we also add (+) geom_violin() to our plot. Enter that now.
  CorrectAnswer: Violin |> ggplot(aes(x=condition, y=value))+geom_violin()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Violin |> ggplot(aes(x=condition, y=value))+geom_violin()')
  Hint: "Does yours look like this -  Violin |> ggplot(aes(x=condition, y=value))+geom_violin()"
  
#14
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Hit the up arrow. Next, let's deal with the other variable in our dataset, muscle. It created three mini-plots through a function called facet_wrap(). Add (+) facet_wrap(~muscle) to your call now.
  CorrectAnswer: Violin |> ggplot(aes(x=condition, y=value))+geom_violin() + facet_wrap(~muscle)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Violin |> ggplot(aes(x=condition, y=value))+geom_violin() + facet_wrap(~muscle)')
  Hint: Maybe you got tripped up where everything goes? Try Violin |> ggplot(aes(x=condition, y=value))+geom_violin() + facet_wrap(~muscle)
  

- Class: script
  Output: Add some arguments to make our violin plots look prettier. Inside geom_violin, we need to specify a few things. We want the inside of the shape (fill) to be "black" the outline of the shape (color) to be "white", the transparency of the shape (alpha) to be .15, and finally, a line to be drawn at the 0.5 quantile (draw_quantile). When you're ready, save and type submit().
  AnswerTests: plot_results_identical('plot')
  Hint: Violin |> ggplot(aes(x=condition, y=value))+geom_violin(fill = "black", alpha = 0.15, colour = "white", draw_quantiles = 0.5) + facet_wrap(~muscle)
  Script: ggplot1.R

  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot')
  CorrectAnswer: plot
  Hint: Type plot.
  
#17

- Class: script
  Output: Great. Let's add the mean point and lines to the plot. When you're ready, save and type submit().
  AnswerTests: plot_results_identical('plot')
  Script: ggplot2.R
  Hint: stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", size = 3) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "line", linewidth = 1, aes(group=muscle)) to your script.
  
#18
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now output what you've done so far by typing plot into the console.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot')
  CorrectAnswer: plot
  Hint: Type plot.

#19
- Class: script
  Output: Now, let's add the confidence intervals of the mean and the points of each observation. When you're ready, save and type submit().
  AnswerTests: plot_results_identical('plot')
  Hint: Try adding stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal, geom = "errorbar",  size = 1,  width = 0) + geom_jitter(width=.10,alpha=0.3) to the script.
  Script: ggplot3.R

  CorrectAnswer: plot
  Hint: Type plot.

#21
- Class: script
  Output: Finally, clean up the x and y axes labels and change the font size. When you're ready, save and type submit().
  AnswerTests: plot_results_identical('plot')
  Hint: Try adding xlab("Condition")+ ylab("Natural logarithm of peak amplitude")+ theme_bw(base_size = 12) to the script.
  Script: ggplot4.R

  CorrectAnswer: plot
  Hint: Type plot.

#23
- Class: text
  Output: You've done it! Whew. Hopefully, you can see how customizable ggplot can be, and you've learned some both basics (geom_violin() and geom_jitter()) as well as more advanced (facet_wrap()) ways to change ggplot2 around.
