  Hint: "Don't change anything, just type submit(). If you did and you don't know how to fix it, just type skip(), and you'll be all set."

  Output: Pivoting data is essential to upgrading your R coding knowledge.
  
- Class: text
  Output: When discussing pivoting data, we mean reshaping data --- turning some columns into additional rows or adding more columns and reducing the number of rows.

- Class: text
  Output: When we add columns, we add more columns to the right of the data. In this way, we are making our data wider.
  
- Class: text
  Output: When we add rows, we reduce the number of columns and add more rows to the data. In this way, we are making our data longer.
  
- Class: text
  Output: In tidyr, two functions, pivot_wider() and pivot_longer(), serve these purposes. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: We will start with pivot_longer(). You will most commonly face pivoting longer when dealing with a study of repeated measures - when you ask a participant to respond to the same question at multiple time points or under different conditions. 
 
- Class: text
  Output: The first study comes from Heyman et al. (YEAR). They wanted to test to see if 
  
- Class: text
  Output: The citation is Heyman, T., Vankrunkelsven, H., Voorspoels, W., White, A., Storms, G., & Verheyen, S. (2020). When Cheating is an Honest Mistake- A Critical Evaluation of the Matrix Task as a Measure of Dishonesty. Collabra- Psychology, 6(1), 12. doi.org/10.1525/collabra.294
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To do this, we have loaded a dataset from the Repeated Measures ANOVA module before we fixed it up. Check the variables in the dataset by piping the dataset name HeymanWide, into names().
  CorrectAnswer: HeymanWide |> names()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='HeymanWide |> names()')
  Hint: Try HeymanWide |> names().

- Class: text
  Output: Great. So, there are nine columns. One, ResponseId, identifies the participant. The other eight columns are the different conditions to which each participant was exposed. Remember, a tidy dataset should have one row per observation - equal to each participant having eight rows since we observed them in eight different conditions. 

- Class: text
  Output: The great thing about pivot_longer is that it is highly flexible. There are many ways we can pivot the data. We'll start by considering three key arguments in pivot_longer -- cols, names_to, and values_to. 

- Class: text
  Output: cols takes a list of columns to pivot. You also can tell it a list of columns NOT to pivot using -. How many variables you have depends on what you should use. 
 
- Class: text
  Output: Next, consider what pivot_longer is doing. It will create one column that serves as a factor with as many levels as pivoted columns. The names_to="" argument will define what we call that column.

- Class: text
  Output: It also creates a column that will be the values pulled out from the cell from the column that was just named. We define how we name that column in the values_to="" argument.
  
- Class: script
  Output: Let's try pivoting the wide data into the long format.  When you're ready, save your script and type submit().
  AnswerTests: script_results_identical('HeymanLong')
  Hint: 'HeymanLong <- HeymanWide |> pivot_longer(cols = -"ResponseId", names_to = "Condition", values_to = "PHelp")'
  Script: pivotlonger.R

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Great job. Let's view this new data by piping our newly created dataset, HeymanLong, into head(10).
  CorrectAnswer: HeymanLong |> head(10)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="HeymanLong |> head(10)")
  Hint: Try HeymanLong |> head(10)

- Class: text
  Output: The notes walk through a few more examples of how pivoting might be necessary for your data, including shortcuts to selecting columns (starts_with(c("Pre", "Post"))) and when you might have multiple variables you want to pivot (a pre/post measure of likelihood and a pre/post measure of guilt).

- Class: text
  Output: pivot_wider() does the reverse - it takes data and creates multiple columns based on that data. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: Imagine, for instance, you are working with someone who wants to analyze the data in Jamovi or SPSS. This would require that the data be *wide*, not long. And imagine you only had HeymanLong to give them. How could we turn it back to the wide format?
  
- Class: text
  Output: The basic pivot_wider has a sister set of arguments to pivot_longer. While pivot_longer() took id=, names_to=, values_to=, pivot_wider takes id_cols=, names_from=, values_from=. 
  
- Class: script
  Output: Let's try re-pivoting the long data back into wide. When you're ready, save your script and type submit().
  AnswerTests: script_results_identical('HeymanWide2')
  Hint: 'HeymanWide2 <- HeymanLong |> pivot_wider(id_cols = "ResponseId", names_from = "Condition", values_from = "PHelp")'
  Script: pivotwider.R

  Output: Would you like to submit the log of this lesson to Google Forms so that your instructor may evaluate your progress?
  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  CorrectAnswer: NULL
  AnswerTests: submit_log()
  Hint: hint
