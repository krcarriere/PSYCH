- Class: text
  Output: Hello! Welcome to Research Methods and Statistics. I'm your host, Kevin R. Carriere.

#2
- Class: text
  Output: This class is focused on the various types of study designs we can do as researchers. 

#3
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which one of these is not a type of study?
  AnswerChoices: Naturalistic Observation;Case Study Research;Logical Research;Correlational Research;Differential Research;Experimental Research 
  CorrectAnswer: Logical Research 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Logical Research")
  Hint: One of these was not discussed in class.

#4
- Class: text
  Output: "Right!\n\nNaturalistic observation is when we simply observe out in the world what is happening. We can consider people like Jane Goddall and her studies on Chimpanzees. \n\nA case study method of research involves examining a single individual and studying them intently. We could consider many old-school therapists to do similar lines of research like this.\n\nThe more important three, in terms of this class, are Correlational, Differential, and Experimental. We will explore each in turn."

#5
- Class: text
  Output: "First, let's talk about correlational research. For instance, we might be interested in how father's height relates to son's height. "

#6
- Class: figure
  Output: Let's load in some data. I've loaded in a few scatterplots in your environment.
  Figure: fathersheight.R
  FigureType: new

#7
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To look at this question (How do father's height and son's height relate), type in scatterplot. 
  CorrectAnswer: scatterplot
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='scatterplot')
  Hint: Type 'scatterplot' without quotes. 

#8
- Class: text
  Output: "Awesome! As we can see, on the x-axis (the bottom axis), is father's height."

#9
- Class: text
  Output: "On the y-axis (the one to the left) is son's height. These are both in inches."

#10
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Can we see a relationship?
  AnswerChoices: As father height increases, son height decreases;As father height increases, son height increases;There is no relation between father height and son height
  CorrectAnswer: As father height increases, son height increases
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="As father height increases, son height increases")
  Hint: Imagine drawing a line - would it go up, down, or straight across?
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What do we call this type of correlation?
  AnswerChoices: Positive correlation;Negative correlation;No correlation
  CorrectAnswer: Positive correlation
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Positive correlation")
  Hint: Imagine drawing a line - would it go up, down, or straight across?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Exactly! To see what this line would look like, type in scatterplot_line to view the second graph I've created. 
  CorrectAnswer: scatterplot_line
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='scatterplot_line')
  Hint: Type 'scatterplot_line' without quotes. 

- Class: text
  Output: "Exactly! Correlational studies are exactly this. We look at two 'things' out in the world, and see if (and how) they are related."

- Class: text
  Output: "There are risks to correlational research, however, which we will discuss in later classes."

- Class: text
  Output: "But, for example, consider the following."

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What would the relationship be between ice cream sales and shark attacks?
  AnswerChoices: Positive correlation;Negative correlation;No correlation
  CorrectAnswer: Positive correlation
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Positive correlation")
  Hint: When do most shark attacks happen? And when do most ice cream sales happen? Therefore, if ice cream sales go up during the summer, would we expect more or less shark attacks during that time?

- Class: text
  Output: "Exactly! And we wouldn't want to ban ice cream in order to save ourselves from shark attacks!"

- Class: text
  Output: "Instead, we would want to examine our question a different way. We could consider, perhaps, comparing people who eat ice cream, and people who are lactose intolerant and do not eat ice cream, and see if there is a difference in shark attacks between these groups."  

- Class: text
  Output: "Or, we might want to compare people who go to the beach and people who do not go to the beach, and see if there is a difference in amount of shark attacks between these two groups."  

#20
- Class: text
  Output: "Both of these cases we're finding a difference in the population, and then seeing if there are differences between these two already-made groups."  

- Class: text
  Output: "This is called differential research."  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For fun, I've made up some fake data to examine this question. To see a graph of the results, type differential_graph. 
  CorrectAnswer: differential_graph
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='differential_graph')
  Hint: Type 'differential_graph' without quotes. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Looking at the graph, do you see large differences between lactose intolerant people and non-lactose intolerant people?
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No;Im not sure
  CorrectAnswer: No
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="No")
  Hint: We're trying to compare the bars by their color. Does the darker grey look much different than the lighter grey?

- Class: text
  Output: "Exactly. There really doesn't seem to be much of a difference when we compare those within the 'beach goer' category in terms of their tolerance for lactose (95 vs 100) nor in the non-beach-goer group (10 vs 15)."  

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Looking at the graph, do you see large differences between beach goers  and non-beach-goers?
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No;Im not sure
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Yes")
  Hint: Now we're looking at the two groups of bars. Is one group of bars significantly taller than the other?

- Class: text
  Output: "Correct! We can see that the beach-goers report significantly more shark attacks than non-beach-goers."  

- Class: text
  Output: In the last example, we seemed to conclude that being a beach-goer is related to having more shark attacks. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: But, what if people who enjoy shark attacks (there has to be someone out there) go to the beach more often?
  
- Class: text
  Output: Maybe, beach-goers are just more adventurous and want to take that risk! Perhaps we're measuring the wrong thing. What can we do about this?

#30
- Class: text
  Output: What we'd really like is to randomly assign beach-goers and non-beach-goers to either going to the beach or not, and measure how many times each group was attacked by a shark. 

- Class: text
  Output: But for a multitude of reasons, that doesn't sound feasible. 

- Class: text
  Output: In a sense, we want to really understand what causes what. We can try to do this through experimental design.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What do all experiments need to have?
  AnswerChoices: At least one manipulated independent variable;Randomly assign participants to their conditions;Attempts to hold all else constant;All of the choices
  CorrectAnswer: All of the choices
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="All of the choices")

- Class: text
  Output: Great! Let's review.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Researchers hypothesize that Republicans have stronger authortarianism scores than Non-Republicans. They recruit 30 Republicans and 30 controls and compare their scores on an authortarianism scale.
  AnswerChoices: Naturalistic Observation;Case Study Research;Logical Research;Correlational Research;Differential Research;Experimental Research 
  CorrectAnswer: Differential Research
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Differential Research")
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Researchers hypothesize that higher authortarianism scores are related to lower support for human rights. They recruit 100 subjects and have them fill out an Authortarianism scale and a Support for Human Rights Scale. 
  AnswerChoices: Naturalistic Observation;Case Study Research;Logical Research;Correlational Research;Differential Research;Experimental Research 
  CorrectAnswer: Correlational Research
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Correlational Research")
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: A new classroom in France is teaching human rights at an early age. Researchers observe the students classroom discussions and playground activities, taking detailed notes throughout. 
  AnswerChoices: Naturalistic Observation;Case Study Research;Logical Research;Correlational Research;Differential Research;Experimental Research 
  CorrectAnswer: Naturalistic Observation
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Naturalistic Observation")

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Researchers hypothesize that people who fear a terrorist attack will be more likely to restrict economic and political freedoms than those who do not fear an attack. They randomly assign half of the participants to read a news article detailing out reports that state their hometown is either highly or not highly likely to be targetted by a terrorist attack in the next six months. They then measure how supportive they are of people assembling in groups and having freedom of religion.
  AnswerChoices: Naturalistic Observation;Case Study Research;Logical Research;Correlational Research;Differential Research;Experimental Research 
  CorrectAnswer: Experimental Research
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Experimental Research")
