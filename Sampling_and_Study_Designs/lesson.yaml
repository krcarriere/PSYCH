- Class: text
  Output: Today, we will continue our discussion of validity and see how we can apply it to our own study designs.

- Class: text
  Output: Two key terms we will discuss is random sampling and random assignment.

- Class: text
  Output: Random sampling is selection from the population - we try our best to get a representative and random sample so that we can truly generalize our results to the population.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Random sampling would be an asset to
  AnswerChoices: External Validity;Internal Validity;Reliability;Floor Effects
  CorrectAnswer: External Validity
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='External Validity')
  Hint: It ensures that our results are generalizable. When we take care about generalizability, we are focusing on which type of validity?

- Class: text
  Output: Random assignment is talking specifically about conditions. If we have a drug and a placebo pill, we would want to make sure that participants are randomly assigned to either drug or placeabo - that we aren't consciously or unconsciously putting all men into drug and all women into placeabo.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Random assignment would be an asset to
  AnswerChoices: External Validity;Internal Validity;Reliability;Floor Effects
  CorrectAnswer: Internal Validity
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Internal Validity')
  Hint: It ensures that our study controls for everything. In the above example, we might not be able to tell if it was the drug, or simply a gender difference. When we care about the internal workings of a study, what kind of validity are we trying to protect?

- Class: text
  Output: Random sampling - giving everyone an equal shot of participating - is important. It can help reduce a biased sample.
  
- Class: text
  Output: One very often talked about biased sample is what we usually have in Psychology studies - Psychology undergraduates. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: We call them WEIRD Samples - western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic samples. We try and generalize about the world, but are we really, or are we just generalizing about western democratically raised students?

- Class: text
  Output: The next thing is random assignment. This refers to our study design. There are three main study designs we will talk about.
  
- Class: text
  Output: There is between subjects, within subjects, and mixed design (when we use both within and between).

- Class: text
  Output: We'll start with between subjects. Between Subjects means that each subject is eposed to only one possible condition.
  
- Class: text
  Output: If you notice key words such as 'some participants received...' or 'half of the participants' or 'participants were separated by...' - these are all clues that it is a between subjects design.
  
- Class: text
  Output: In the real world, there are tons of ways we already do between-subject designs. We compare men vs. women, or right handed vs left handed, or chess masters vs. normal individuals. 

- Class: text
  Output: All three of them are group divisions. We take a random group, and divide them - half go into the group we call men, half into the group we call women. 

- Class: text
  Output: However, you'll notice that these are all groups that go without the experimenter needing to do anything. 

- Class: text
  Output: Of course, we can divide people up into groups whenever we want. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: "For example, Tajfel and colleagues (1971) asked participants to estimate the number of dots shown on a screen. Then they were told they had been placed into groups based on similar estimations (if you said 50, your group members also said 50). In reality, these two groups were simply randomly assigned, half placed in A, half in B. They then asked the individuals to  split up money between the two groups. Even on this simple group division - members of Group A gave more money to Group A than members of Group B, and vice versa. \n\n Tajfel, H., Billig, M. G., Bundy, R. P., & Flament, C. (1971).

- Class: mult_question
  Output: In that example, what was the manipulated, between-subjects, independent variable?
  AnswerChoices: Group membership;Amount of dots seen; Amount of money shared; Hair color
  CorrectAnswer: Group membership
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Group membership')

- Class: text
  Output: Between-Subjects Designs are typically done one of two ways. We can either do a Post-Test, or a Pre Test v Post Test. 

- Class: text
  Output: Post-test would be like what happened in the example above. Participants were assigned to their conditions (i.e. received the treatment) and then were tested.
  
- Class: text 
  Output: Other examples would be like giving individuals a drug (or not) and seeing if they get better after receiving the drug.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Pre-Post is similar, but we also test their baseline. For example, we could have everyone take a statistics test, then half of the people we tested we let them sit in on this course, and the other half do not sit in on this course. Then, at the end, everyone takes the test again, and we see if taking this course improved how you understood statistics and research methods!

- Class: text
  Output: Within-Subjects is also called Repeated-Measures. In this, we compare each subject to themselves. 

- Class: text
  Output: For example, we might be interested in whether or not you test differently based on temperature, so first we bring you into a cold room and take a test, then bring you into a warm room and make you take the same test.
  
- Class: text
  Output: This is good because there is no chance variation - you at time one is not different than you at time two. It also means intead of paying, say, 40 participants, we only have to pay 20, because they're doing twice the amount of work!
  
- Class: text
  Output: However, there are many reasons why sometimes Within Subjects is not feasible. For example, if we want to test the policy implications of poverty, we can't ask people to both be in poverty for a year and then not be in poverty for a year.

- Class: text
  Output: Also, if the aim of the study becomes too obvious by doing multiple conditions, we might bias our results if the participants understand and notice the differences. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: A key confound that is present in a lot of within-subjects studies that needs to be controlled for is sequence effects. Sequence effects generally means exposure to one condition can influence future conditions.
  
- Class: text
  Output: This could be Practice Effects - when participants get better over time just because they are being exposed to the same questions. Or, they might be getting tired, and their scores may naturally go down (negative practice effects).
  
- Class: text
  Output: There are also Carryover Effects - where the exposure for one of the conditions is so strong it carries over to other conditions. For example, if I had you first drink coffee, then alcohol, then water, the effects of alcohol would carry over into the effects of drinking water.
  
- Class: text
  Output: We try to fix these issues by counter-balancing. Maybe some people receive A->B->C, others B->C->A, others C->A->B, others C->B->A. etc. If we present every possible order, then it is complete counterbalancing. If we only present some, we call it partial counterbalancing.
