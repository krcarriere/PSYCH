#1
- Class: text
  Output: Hello! And welcome to the second lecture of Psychology Statistics. 

#2
- Class: text
  Output: Today, we are going to go over variables. 
#3
- Class: text
  Output: The first distinction we need to make is the difference between an independent variable and a dependent variable.
#4
- Class: text
  Output: A dependent variable DEPENDS on the independent variable.
#5 - Multiple Choice - DV
- Class: mult_question
  Output: If we were studying which type of weapon (gun, fist, verbal insult) causes the most harm, what is the dependent variable?
  AnswerChoices: Type of weapon;Amount of harm;More information is needed
  CorrectAnswer: Amount of harm
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Amount of harm')
  Hint: What depends on the other?
#6
- Class: text
  Output: Right! And so, then, in comparison, an independent variable is a variable that determines the participant's response. 
#7
- Class: text
  Output: Your response of pain would be very different if you were insulted versus punched versus shot. 
#8
- Class: text
  Output: This difference will be very, very important! And it will show up on exams. 
#9
- Class: text
  Output: An independent variable is manipulated in experiments. Some people may receive a drug, while others receive nothing. That is an independent variable.
#10
- Class: text
  Output: In contrast, a dependent variable is typically measured in experiments. We want to see how MUCH you will do something (get better from treatment, for example). 
#11  
- Class: text
  Output: Let's try another example. 
#12 - Multiple Choice - IV
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "306 participants read a newspaper article depicting four alleged cases of coalition military personnel torturing and killing Iraqi civilians in a prison near Baghdad. For half of the participants, the perpetrators were described as U.S. soldiers, whereas the other half the perpetrators were described as Iraqi soldiers. Participants then were asked about how much justice should be given to the victims of this crime. \n\nWhat is the independent variable in this study? \n\n For citation see Leinder Castano Zaiser & Giner-Sorolla 2010. Ingroup glorification, moral disengagement, and justice in the context of collective violence. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 36(8), 1115-1129."
  AnswerChoices: The amount of justice given;The type of torture;Who the torturers were
  CorrectAnswer: Who the torturers were
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Who the torturers were')
  Hint: One of these things differed randomly for half of the participants. Which one?
#13
- Class: text
  Output: Great! Now what about the dependent variable? 
  
#14 - DV
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "306 participants read a newspaper article depicting four alleged cases of coalition military personnel torturing and killing Iraqi civilians in a prison near Baghdad. For half of the participants, the perpetrators were described as U.S. soldiers, whereas the other half the perpetrators were described as Iraqi soldiers. Participants then were asked about how much justice should be given to the victims of this crime. \n\nWhat is the dependent variable in this study? \n\n For citation see Leinder Castano Zaiser & Giner-Sorolla 2010. Ingroup glorification, moral disengagement, and justice in the context of collective violence. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 36(8), 1115-1129."
  AnswerChoices: The amount of justice given;The type of torture;Who the torturers were
  CorrectAnswer: The amount of justice given
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The amount of justice given')
  Hint: One of these things was asked for all participants to rate. Which one is it?

#15
- Class: text
  Output: Exactly. We expect that the level of justice will DEPEND on whether or not it was U.S. or Iraqi soldiers. 

#16
- Class: text
  Output: If you're interested, this study showed that if you identified strongly with the coalition forces, you were less likely to want justice if it was American soldiers. If it was the Iraqi soldiers, it did not matter - you wanted justice. 

#17
- Class: text
  Output: While we said that independent variables are manipulated in experiments, in some studies, they are simply measured. For example, we might be interested in gender differences. We cannot manipulate someone's gender. But! We can use it as an independent variable. 

#18
- Class: text
  Output: "For correlational studies, these are typically many kinds of numbers (Father's height, for example). For differential studies, like Gender, we can consider them to be a very small subset of numbers (Either Girl or Boy, 0 or 1)."
  
#19 - Multiple Choice - IV
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Another pop quiz! \n\n 141 participants read a short sentence. Randomly, without them knowing, the sentence either said: (1) John Demjanjuk has been convicted of aiding the Nazis in the murder of at least 28,000 Jews at the Sobibor Polish concentration camp during World War II. (2) John Demjanjuk has been convicted of aiding the Nazis in the murder of at least 28,000 Jews at the Sobibor concentration camp in Poland during World War II. or (3) John Demjanjuk has been convicted of aiding the Nazis in the murder of at least 28,000 Jews at the Sobibor concentration camp during World War II. Participants then were asked to rate how responsible Germans, Poles, and Jews were for the Holocaust and asked to rate their feelings towards all three groups. \n\n What was the independent variable? \n\n Mazur, L. 2016. Where Were The Concentration Camps? The Porous Border Between Geography And Responsibility. Psychology & Society, 8(2), 27-48."
  AnswerChoices: The group asked about in the question; The sentence presented; Not enough information
  CorrectAnswer: The sentence presented
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The sentence presented')
  Hint: One of these things was only shown for some of the participants and not all of them.

#20 - Levels of the IV

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Great! How many levels (or different groups) were in this independent variable?"
  AnswerChoices: 1;2;3;4;0
  CorrectAnswer: 3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='3')
  Hint: How many different sentences were possible?

#21
- Class: text
  Output: "Great. We'll get to levels a bit more later, but it's good you noticed how there were different amounts of sentences."

#22

- Class: text
  Output: "The next important thing about variables, beyond independent or dependent, is the type of variable."
  
#23

- Class: text
  Output: "We typically break variables into 4 'scales of measurement': Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, or Ratio."

#24 - View Data

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Let's look at some data. I've loaded some data into RStudio for you. This is a dataset that examines different kinds of diamonds and their carats. \n\n Type head(data) to get a look at what this data looks like."
  CorrectAnswer: head(data)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(data)')
  Hint: Type 'head(data)' without quotes. 

#25
- Class: text
  Output: "Great! This showed us the first few lines of our dataset."

#26 - Nominal

- Class: text
  Output: "Nominal variables can be remembered by Nominal = Name. They refer to qualitative variables - things like gender, your name, the color of the diamond."

#27
- Class: text
  Output: "They aren't things that we can easily assign a number to."

#28  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "To see an example of a nominal variable, type table(data$color)."
  CorrectAnswer: table(data$color)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='table(data$color)')
  Hint: Type 'table(data$color)' without quotes. 

#29
- Class: text
  Output: "Great! So we can see there are these various colors - D, E, F, G, H, I, J. And using table(), we were able to find out how many of each type we have."

#30 - Ordinal
- Class: text
  Output: "The next type of variable is an ordinal variable."

#31

- Class: text
  Output: "Values of ordinal variables represent rank, but don't tell us anything about magnitude."

#32

- Class: text
  Output: "Think about things like a small, medium, or large. You don't know just from those words how much smaller a small is from a large."
  
#33

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "To see an example of a ordinal variable, type levels(data$cut)."
  CorrectAnswer: levels(data$cut)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='levels(data$cut)')
  Hint: Type 'levels(data$cut)' without quotes.
  
#34
- Class: text
  Output: "Great! So we see that this variable, 'cut', has 5 levels, or ranks. There's fair (like small), good, very good, premium, and ideal."
  
#35 - Interval
- Class: text
  Output: "The next variable type is an interval variable."

#36
- Class: text
  Output: "An interval variable has equal intervals, but no true zero."

#37
- Class: text
  Output: "Interval variables are things we can add and subtract. But! We can't multiply it."

#38
- Class: text
  Output: "For example, temperature is an interval variable. We can understand that the difference between 61 and 62 is the same as the difference between 45 and 46 degrees."

#39
- Class: text
  Output: "But, it would be incorrect to say that 40 degrees is half as warm as 80 degrees."
  
#40
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "To see an example of an interval variable, type psych::describeBy(data$carat)."
  CorrectAnswer: psych::describeBy(data$carat)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='psych::describeBy(data$carat)')
  Hint: Type 'psych::describeBy(data$carat)' without quotes.

#41
- Class: text
  Output: "So what we see is that these variables have means, they have medians, they have mins and maxs, and ranges."
  
#42 - Ratio
- Class: text
  Output: "Ratio variables are very similar, except they have a true zero. We can understand height or weight or distance as a ratio variable."

#43
- Class: text
  Output: "Four feet is twice as high as two feet."
  
#44
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "To see an example of an ratio variable, type psych::describeBy(data$price)."
  CorrectAnswer: psych::describeBy(data$price)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='psych::describeBy(data$price)')
  Hint: Type 'psych::describeBy(data$price)' without quotes.

#45
- Class: text
  Output: "These look very similar to our interval variables! And they are. Overall, you'll be handling interval variables the most during this course."

#46
- Class: text
  Output: "While any DV or any IV can have any scale of measurement, the measurements we choose influence how we analyze the data."

#47
- Class: text
  Output: "If you have an Interval:Ratio DV and an Interval:Ratio IV, you usually do some form of correlation. \n\n A Nominal:Ordinal IV and an Interval:Ratio DV will be either a t-test or an ANOVA (we will focus on these). \n\n A Nominal:Ordinal DV and a Nominal:Ordinal IV is a chi-square."

#48
- Class: text
  Output: "Finally, we need to talk about definitions."

#49
- Class: text
  Output: "As psychologists, we may be interested in a wide range of behavior - anxiety, support for human rights, intelligence."

#50
- Class: text
  Output: "These things are our concepts, and we can define them conceptually. Support for human rights, for example, would include support for all UN Declaration of Human Rights."

#51
- Class: text
  Output: "However, in experiments, sometimes it's not so clear. How do you study this concept called anxiety? Or this concept called Support for Human Righst? These things we want to study are called constructs."

#52
- Class: text
  Output: "Instead, we might measure one's heart rate while a spider crawls up their arm. In this case, heart rate is how we want to measure anxiety. We call this the operational definition."

#54 - DV
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Researchers are interested in studying support for human rights violations. They present subjects with a story that American soldiers have captured an enemy that may have intelligence (half read it was 20%, while the other half read 60% likely) that would help them. They also find out that the enemy in the past either had killed three children or had injured three soldiers. Participants were asked if the use of torture on the enemy was acceptable on a scale of 1-Strongly Disagree and 7- Strongly Agree. \n\n What was the dependent variable in this study? \n\n For citation see Drolet, C. E. Hafer, C. L. Heuer, L. 2016. The role of perceived deservingness in the toleration of human rights violations."
  AnswerChoices: Who the enemy had killed previously;Likelihood of information;How acceptable torture was;Support for free speech
  CorrectAnswer: How acceptable torture was
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='How acceptable torture was')
  Hint: Think - dependent DEPENDS on what else is going on. What (hopefully) will depend on everything else?

# 55- Type of DV
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Researchers are interested in studying support for human rights violations. They present subjects with a story that American soldiers have captured an enemy that may have intelligence (half read it was 20%, while the other half read 60% likely) that would help them. They also find out that the enemy in the past either had killed three children or had injured three soldiers. Participants were asked if the use of torture on the enemy was acceptable on a scale of 1-Strongly Disagree and 7- Strongly Agree. \n\n What is the scale of measurement of this dependent variable? \n\n For citation see Drolet, C. E. Hafer, C. L. Heuer, L. 2016. The role of perceived deservingness in the toleration of human rights violations."
  AnswerChoices: Nominal;Ordinal;Interval;Ratio
  CorrectAnswer: Interval
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Interval')
  Hint: Nominal=name. Ordinal=order only. Can we subtract the differences and have it still make sense?

#56 - IV
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Researchers are interested in studying support for human rights violations. They present subjects with a story that American soldiers have captured an enemy that may have intelligence (half read it was 20%, while the other half read 60% likely) that would help them. They also find out that the enemy in the past either had killed three children or had injured three soldiers. Participants were asked if the use of torture on the enemy was acceptable on a scale of 1-Strongly Disagree and 7- Strongly Agree. \n\n What was (or were) the independent variable(s) in this study? \n\n For citation see Drolet, C. E. Hafer, C. L. Heuer, L. 2016. The role of perceived deservingness in the toleration of human rights violations."
  AnswerChoices: Who the enemy had killed previously;Likelihood of information;How acceptable torture was;Who the enemy had killed previously and likelihood of information;Who the enemy had killed previously and willingness to torture;Likelihood of information and willingness to torture; 
  CorrectAnswer: Who the enemy had killed previously and likelihood of information
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Who the enemy had killed previously and likelihood of information')
  Hint: This study was a bit more complicated. Do you see more than one thing that varied between people?
