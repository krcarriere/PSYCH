- Class: text
  Output: This module is the non-parametric alternative to the paired t-test module. While that module gets a bit heavy at the end in trying to understand effect sizes of paired t-tests, this module will go into more depth of non-normality testing. You can also take the Testing for Non-Normality Module for additional review.

- Class: text
  Output: So, what does it mean to be non-parametric?
  
- Class: text
  Output: It means that it is a method of analysis that does not include assumptions regarding distributions. So, what assumptions are in the paired t-test?

- Class: text
  Output: "The assumptions of a paired t-test are - \n\n (1) The samples are randomly selected from the population. \n\n (2) The pairs of observations are independent from other pairs. \n\n (3) The difference between the pairs are normally distributed. "
  
- Class: text
  Output: That third assumption -- that the differences between the pairs are normally distributed -- is something we can test. It is very important to note here that we said <differences>. In dependent samples, we solely want to ask if the difference score between Group 1 and Group 2 is normally distributed with a normal variance.

- Class: text
  Output: We are going to examine two papers within this Module. In the first study, Knight & Preston (2023) wondered if how we take photos of ourselves - selfies - impact how others perceive us. They examined this question over four studies.

- Class: text
  Output: The citation for this paper is - Knight, R., & Preston, C. (2023). Do selfies make women look slimmer? The effect of viewing angle on aesthetic and weight judgments of women’s bodies. PLoS ONE, 18(10), e0291987. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0291987
  
- Class: text
  Output: We will examine Study 1, where they exposed women who were 18 years old or older and did not have a history of eating disorders to view 20 photos of female models (excluding their head) who were asked to wear form-fitting clothes that they would exercise in.

- Class: text
  Output: In Study 1, half of those 20 photos were of the selfie view, where the model took the selfie angle with the tablet held in their left hand an arms-length away angled from above. The other 10 photos were of the allocentric view, where the photographer stood roughly two metres in front of the model capturing the whole body (asking a friend to take a photo of you).

#11
- Class: text
  Output: For each photo, participants rated, on a scale from 0 to 100, both attractiveness (anchored with ‘Very Unattractive’ and ‘Very Attractive’) and weight (‘Very Underweight’ and ‘Very Overweight’). 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's look at the data now by piping (|>) our dataset (Selfies) into head(). 
  CorrectAnswer: Selfies |> head()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Selfies |> head()')
  Hint: Try Selfies |> head().

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on the output, what is the fourth variable?
  AnswerChoices: The average attractiveness rating for selfie photos; The average attractiveness rating for allocentric photos; The average weight rating for selfie photos; The average weight rating for allocentric photos.
  CorrectAnswer: The average attractiveness rating for selfie photos
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The average attractiveness rating for selfie photos')
  Hint: The two words should point us to what the correct answer must be.

- Class: text
  Output: You should notice a few things with this data. First, participants were exposed to both conditions - they rated BOTH the allocentric photos and the selfie-photos. This is a big shining light that the study is dependent samples. But, as we mentioned in the Module already, the assumptions for dependent samples cares not about the average of each condition, but instead, the differences between the two conditions. And those variables - for both weight and attractiveness - don't yet exist.

- Class: script
  Output: We've loaded a script to use mutate() in the dplyr package to create these two new variables. Save your script before you type submit().
  AnswerTests: script_results_identical('Selfies')
  Hint: Follow the notes in the script, and be sure you saved your script (using the save button or ctrl+S) before typing submit() in the Console.
  Script: differences.R
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Wonderful job! Let's check that everything is working as intended by piping (|>) our dataset (Selfies) into head(). 
  CorrectAnswer: Selfies |> head()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Selfies |> head()')
  Hint: Try Selfies |> head().

- Class: text
  Output: It worked! Now the authors state- "Data for all variables (...differences in attractiveness judgements across perspectives, differences in weight judgements across perspectives...) were not normally distributed, according to Shapiro-Wilk tests ... and analysis of histograms. Because of this, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used."

- Class: text
  Output: Let's see how they came to this conclusion. They first mention Shapiro-Wilk tests.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We show two ways to run Shapiro-Wilk tests in the Notes, but in this module, we'll focus on the rstatix version, shapiro_test(). Take our data, Selfies, and pipe it into shapiro_test(), with a single argument, WeightDiff.
  CorrectAnswer: Selfies |> shapiro_test(WeightDiff)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Selfies |> shapiro_test(WeightDiff)')
  Hint: Try Selfies |> rstatix::shapiro_test(WeightDiff).
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Very good! As the p value is smaller than .05, we reject the null hypothesis that the differences are normal for the weight judgments. What about attractiveness? Hit up on your keyboard to pull up the last code, and change WeightDiff to AttractDiff.
  CorrectAnswer: Selfies |> shapiro_test(AttractDiff)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Selfies |> shapiro_test(AttractDiff)')
  Hint: Try Selfies |> rstatix::shapiro_test(AttractDiff)

#21

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The authors also mentioned they examined histograms. So, let's do that too! It's good practice to use all tools at our disposal to determine if our assumptions are violated. Let us take our data, Selfies, and pipe it into the tidyverse verb pull(), which will take the argument WeightDiff, and then pipe that into the function hist(). Try that now.
  CorrectAnswer: Selfies |> pull(WeightDiff) |> hist()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Selfies |> pull(WeightDiff) |> hist()')
  Hint: Try Selfies |> pull(WeightDiff) |> hist()

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can see that the histogram looks like it has a tail on the lefthand side. That's probably what the shapiro_test() is picking up on when it says its not very normal. You know the drill, hit up, change WeightDiff to AttractDiff.
  CorrectAnswer: Selfies |> pull(AttractDiff) |> hist()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Selfies |> pull(AttractDiff) |> hist()')
  Hint: Try Selfies |> pull(AttractDiff) |> hist()
  
- Class: text
  Output: Well this one is even more clear - look at that outlier over there! And beyond that, look how clumped the rest of the data is. Clearly, this is not the shape of a normal distribution. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: Now, with these two tools in hand, the authors proceeded. However, let us add one more tool to our arsenal. We also can use a qqplot to analyze the normality of the differences. 
  
- Class: script
  Output: Follow the instructions. When you're ready, save and type submit().
  AnswerTests: plot_results_identical('WeightQQ')
  Hint: WeightQQ <- Selfies |> ggplot(aes(sample=WeightDiff))+ geom_qq()+ geom_qq_line()
  Script: qqplot.R
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Output what you've done by typing WeightQQ into the console.
  CorrectAnswer: WeightQQ
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='WeightQQ')
  Hint: Type WeightQQ.
  
- Class: text
  Output: See how the observations in the middle touch the line? That's good, that's what we want. However, see how many dots fail to touch the line - both towards the beginning and towards the end? That's not so good. You will get a better sense of what looks normal or not in these qqplots as you expose yourself to more of them.

- Class: text
  Output: Okay, well, all of the evidence suggested that the authors made the right call. 

- Class: text
  Output: The authors write, "In line with our hypotheses a Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed a significant difference in weight ratings between allocentric and selfie images  (W = 387.00, p < .001, rank-biserial correlation = -0.68) such that selfie images were judged to be slimmer than allocentric images.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In the notes, we outline a few different ways to run the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Take our data, Selfies, and pipe it into wilcox.test(). wilcox.test() will take two arguments. The first argument will be a combination of a formula and a function - We need to write Pair(SelfieWeightAv, AlloWeightAv) ~ 1 . The second argument (remember -- arguments are separated by commas) is data = _ . Try that now.
  CorrectAnswer: Selfies |> wilcox.test(Pair(SelfieWeightAv, AlloWeightAv) ~ 1, data=_)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Selfies |> wilcox.test(Pair(SelfieWeightAv, AlloWeightAv) ~ 1, data=_)')
  Hint: Try Selfies |> wilcox.test(Pair(SelfieWeightAv, AlloWeightAv) ~ 1, data=_) .

#31

- Class: text
  Output: That got us the first half (note - R calls the statistic V, but in the paper, they call it W), but what about that rank biserial correlation? 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Hit up on your keyboard. We'll make one small change - instead of wilcox.test, change it to rank_biserial. Hit enter once you have done that.
  CorrectAnswer: Selfies |> rank_biserial(Pair(SelfieWeightAv, AlloWeightAv) ~ 1, data=_)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Selfies |> rank_biserial(Pair(SelfieWeightAv, AlloWeightAv) ~ 1, data=_)')
  Hint: Try Selfies |> rank_biserial(Pair(SelfieWeightAv, AlloWeightAv) ~ 1, data=_) .

- Class: text
  Output: Great job! We walk through other ways to tackle effect sizes in the Notes, including other packages that produce this number (rcompanion's wilcoxonPairedRC()) and ones that produce a very different effect size measure (rstatix's wilcox_effsize). 
  
- Class: text
  Output: Let's do one more - but just quickly. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: "In one study, four-year-old children watched videos of two boys and two girls expressing a preference for one of two stickers. The children then completed a resource distribution task where they distributed 10 liked or ten disliked stickers between themselves and another child. The results showed that children tended to keep more of the liked than disliked stickers for themselves, indicating that their distribution patterns were influenced by their peers' preferences. "
  
- Class: text
  Output: The citation for this study is - "Hennefield, L., & Markson, L. (2017). Four-year-old Children Align their Preferences with those of their Peers. Collabra- Psychology, 3(1), 14. doi.org/10.1525/collabra.89"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's look at our data to see what it looks like. Pipe our data, Stickers, into head() and give head the single argument n=10.
  CorrectAnswer: Stickers |> head(n=10)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Stickers |> head(n=10)')
  Hint: Stickers |> head(n=10)
  
- Class: text
  Output: You can see how there are four columns. The distributions column notes if the child kept an equal number of liked or disliked, more liked, or if they kept all the stickers.
  
- Class: text
  Output: The authors write - "It is unclear how to classify the six children who kept all the stickers.  Indeed, some researchers differentiate between prosocial (distributing at  least one) and non-prosocial (keeping all) children, and exclude those non-prosocial children from subsequent analyses."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Let us filter out those six kids. Pipe Stickers (|>) into the filter() function from dplyr, where we will pass the argument Distributions!="kept all". Be sure to reassign your dataset back to Stickers.'
  CorrectAnswer: Stickers <- Stickers |> filter(Distributions!="kept all")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Stickers <- Stickers |> filter(Distributions!="kept all")')
  Hint: Stickers <- Stickers |> filter(Distributions!="kept all")

#41

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now, let's create a difference variable. To do this, take our data, Stickers and pipe (|>) it into the mutate() function. Inside of that function, let's create a new variable called Difference.Kept, and make it equal to Liked.Kept - Disliked.Kept. Be sure to reassign it as Stickers. Try that now."
  CorrectAnswer: Stickers <- Stickers |> mutate(Difference.Kept = Liked.Kept - Disliked.Kept)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Stickers <- Stickers |> mutate(Difference.Kept = Liked.Kept - Disliked.Kept)')
  Hint: Stickers <- Stickers |> mutate(Difference.Kept = Liked.Kept - Disliked.Kept)

- Class: text
  Output: "The paper reads - A Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test indicates that, overall, children kept marginally more liked (M = 6.5) than disliked (M = 6.1) stickers, (Z = –1.799, p = .072)."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Hit up on your keyboard until you find your wilcox.test() in the console and change the inputs to Stickers, Liked.Kept, Disliked.Kept. If you cannot find it, try Stickers |> wilcox.test(Pair(Liked.Kept, Disliked.Kept)~1, data=_)"
  CorrectAnswer:  Stickers |> wilcox.test(Pair(Liked.Kept, Disliked.Kept)~1, data=_)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Stickers |> wilcox.test(Pair(Liked.Kept, Disliked.Kept)~1, data=_)')
  Hint:  Stickers |> wilcox.test(Pair(Liked.Kept, Disliked.Kept)~1, data=_)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You might be saying "Hey, that's not what they reported." And if you did notice that, good for you! Indeed. This is the reason why we are teaching this test using Pair(). The authors of the study tried a different way, but their method requires that you remind R that the data is paired, and they failed to tell it that. To prove it, we can get their result by inputting the following into the console - wilcox.test(Stickers$Liked.Kept, Stickers$Disliked.Kept, exact=FALSE). 
  CorrectAnswer: wilcox.test(Stickers$Liked.Kept, Stickers$Disliked.Kept, exact=FALSE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='wilcox.test(Stickers$Liked.Kept, Stickers$Disliked.Kept, exact=FALSE)')
  Hint: wilcox.test(Stickers$Liked.Kept, Stickers$Disliked.Kept, exact=FALSE)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: This is actually the Mann-Whitney U-Test! They had forgotten to tell R that these are paired observations. Hit up on your console, and add a fourth argument, paired=TRUE.
  CorrectAnswer: wilcox.test(Stickers$Liked.Kept, Stickers$Disliked.Kept, exact=FALSE, paired=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='wilcox.test(Stickers$Liked.Kept, Stickers$Disliked.Kept, exact=FALSE, paired=TRUE)')
  Hint: wilcox.test(Stickers$Liked.Kept, Stickers$Disliked.Kept, exact=FALSE, paired=TRUE)

- Class: text
  Output: Indeed! If only the researchers had remembered to note that paired=TRUE, or, even better, use our Pair() method, they could have argued that there was a significant difference at their alpha of .05.

- Class: text
  Output: Now, they reported a Z score as an effect size. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's take that in two steps. First step - hit the up arrow on your keyboard to reach our last function (our correct Wilcoxon sign-rank test). At the beginning, create an object called signrank and assign your code to that object.
  CorrectAnswer: signrank <- wilcox.test(Stickers$Liked.Kept, Stickers$Disliked.Kept, exact=FALSE, paired=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='signrank <- wilcox.test(Stickers$Liked.Kept, Stickers$Disliked.Kept, exact=FALSE, paired=TRUE)')
  Hint: signrank <- wilcox.test(Stickers$Liked.Kept, Stickers$Disliked.Kept, exact=FALSE, paired=TRUE)

- Class: mult_question
  Output: If you were to type signrank$ into your console, a list of possible variables would show up. Which of the following does not appear? 
  AnswerChoices: statistic; parameter; p.value; null.value; alternative; method; data.name; sign
  CorrectAnswer: sign
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='sign')
  Hint: You can also click the arrow in your Environment next to signrank and see the list there!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now that we see how even something as simple as a function call also creates variables (similar to a data frame in some ways), we can pass signrank$p.value through qnorm(). However, inside, divide that argument by two because we want a two-tailed test. That will get us our Z statistic.
  CorrectAnswer: qnorm(signrank$p.value/2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='qnorm(signrank$p.value/2)')
  Hint: qnorm(signrank$p.value/2)

#51

- Class: text
  Output: And that's it! Remember, if we're doing a signed rank test, we want to find a way to tell R that we are using paired data. We taught this method through Pair(), but you could also include the DifferenceScore but set paired=TRUE. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Would you like to submit the log of this lesson to Google Forms so that your instructor may evaluate your progress?
  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  CorrectAnswer: NULL
  AnswerTests: submit_log()
  Hint: hint
