#1
- Class: script
  Output: To save the notes for this module, copy and paste the code provided into your RNotebook. Type submit() when you have finished saving these notes. 
  AnswerTests: script_results_identical('saved')
  Hint: "Don't change anything, just type submit(). If you did and you don't know how to fix it, just type skip(), and you'll be all set."
  Script: Notes.R

- Class: text
  Output: It is recommended you take the Basics in R module first. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: Throughout this course, we are going to what is called 'pipe' quite a bit, to the extent that sometimes, it may even be considered inefficient. That may be true - however, our goal is to ensure you are so comfortable with piping that it becomes second nature to you, and as such, we have chosen to overuse piping to impart this lesson throughout the modules.

- Class: text
  Output: The goal of tidy coding strives to make our code readable - it asks us to consider the idea that functions are verbs in a sentence - telling us what our nouns (objects) will do. 

- Class: text
  Output: The pipe operator (|>) provides a way for us to do multiple functions in a more readable way.

- Class: text
  Output: When you see a pipe (|> or %>%), you should read this as "and then." So, the code data |> head() reads, "Take our data and then use head() on it." We will be using what is known as the base pipe (|>) throughout this module. The original pipe, %>%, comes from the magrittr package (a tidy package). We won't get you bogged down into the differences (shrinking every update!) but note that the base R pipe (|>) is quickly becoming the standard.

- Class: text
  Output: The second goal (we get more into this goal in our Pivoting Data Module) is to ensure that a tidy dataset should have 1 row for every participant-observation. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's start our understanding of verbs and nouns by loading a dataset. R has many pre-loaded datasets for practice, and we'll use one of the most common ones, iris, for this module. Please create a new object called data and store (<-) the object iris to it.  
  CorrectAnswer: data <- iris
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data <- iris')
  Hint: Try data <- iris.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Great job. Now, let's take our data and then pipe (|>) it into head(). 
  CorrectAnswer: data |> head()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data |> head()')
  Hint: Try data |> head(). 

#10
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What variable is listed first?
  AnswerChoices: Sepal.Length; Sepal.Width; Petal.Length; Petal.Width; Species
  CorrectAnswer: Sepal.Length
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Sepal.Length')
  Hint: What one shows first?
  
- Class: text
  Output: Now, many times, you may be handling datasets with hundreds of variables! That might be overwhelming, or you should do an analysis on a select few of those variables (see our Correlation module). 
# Select

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can use the select() verb to assist us here. Let's start by storing a new object, data_select. We'll assign it the output of the sentence "Take my data, and then (|>) select() the variables Petal.Length and Species." select() takes names of columns with a comma between each, so it should be as straightforward as select(Petal.Length, Species).
  CorrectAnswer: data_select <- data |> select(Petal.Length, Species)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data_select <- data |> select(Petal.Length, Species)')
  Hint: Try data_select <- data |> select(Petal.Length, Species)

#View Select
- Class: cmd_question 
  Output:  Use the View() function to view the contents of data_select. Pipe data_select into View().
  CorrectAnswer: data_select |> View()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data_select |> View()')
  Hint: Try data_select |> View()
  
# everything()
- Class: cmd_question 
  Output: Great job. What if you still want all of the variables but just want them ordered differently? Let's store this output as data_select2. In this, let's pipe our data into select(), and inside of select, we'll list Petal.Length and Species variables, along with all other variables, by using the everything() argument. Try that now.
  CorrectAnswer: data_select2 <- data |> select(Petal.Length, Species, everything())
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data_select2 <- data |> select(Petal.Length, Species, everything())')
  Hint: Try data_select2 <- data |> select(Petal.Length, Species, everything())
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Great job. Did it work? Let's see. Take our data_select2 dataset and pipe it into names(). names() is a function that will list, in order, the column names.
  CorrectAnswer: data_select2 |> names()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data_select2 |> names()')
  Hint: Try data_select2 |> names(). 

- Class: cmd_question 
  Output: We can also use the - sign to remove variables we don't want anymore. For example, we could use the select() verb to remove the Species variable from data_select2. Pipe data_select2 into select(), with -Species as the argument. Then, use the names() verb to view the names of the variables in the resulting data frame. This also shows you how you can pipe multiple functions into each other. 
  CorrectAnswer: data_select2 |> select(-Species) |> names()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data_select2 |> select(-Species) |> names()')
  Hint: Try data_select2 |> select(-Species) |> names()
  
- Class: text
  Output: That generally covers our select verb. So, if we can add and remove columns (variables), how do we remove observations (rows)? For that, we have the filter() function.
  
- Class: cmd_question 
  Output: For example, let's take our data and pipe (|>) it into filter(), and use the filter() verb to keep only the rows where Sepal.Width is less than (<) 2.5.
  CorrectAnswer: data |> filter(Sepal.Width<2.5)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data |> filter(Sepal.Width<2.5)')
  Hint: Did you do data |> filter(Sepal.Width<2.5) ?
  
#filter multiple
- Class: cmd_question 
  Output: We can include multiple filter conditionals in a variety of ways. You might have two filter() verb steps, the first piping into the second. Or, combine it into one. Let's pipe data into filter() and keep only the rows that Sepal.Width is less than 2.5, and (&) the Species is equal to (==) "setosa" using a single filter() command.
  CorrectAnswer: data |> filter(Sepal.Width<2.5 & Species=="setosa")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data |> filter(Sepal.Width<2.5 & Species=="setosa")')
  Hint: Try data |> filter(Sepal.Width<2.5 & Species=="setosa")
  
#20
- Class: script
  Output: Let us practice writing a long sentence combining what we have learned. We have opened up a script for you, please read and answer the script. When you're ready, save the script and type submit().
  AnswerTests: script_results_identical('length.table')
  Hint: Try skip() if you can't get it, and look to see how the answer looks.
  Script: combine.R

- Class: text
  Output: The main workhorse for data analysis is mutate(), however. mutate() is used to create new variables. In our scripts, when we analyze data, it's not uncommon for the mutate() function to be 50 lines of code long because we are creating so many different variables at the outset.

- Class: text
  Output: The mutate() verb just takes a list of NewVariable = WayToCreateIt calls, with a comma separating each. 
  
#mutate to create new variables
- Class: cmd_question 
  Output:  For example, let's pipe data_select2 into mutate() and create a new variable named DoublePL equal to two times Petal.Length variable. Then, pipe the resulting data frame into head() to view the first few rows.
  CorrectAnswer: data_select2 |>  mutate(DoublePL = Petal.Length*2 ) |> head()
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('data_select2 |>  mutate(DoublePL = Petal.Length*2 ) |> head()', 'data_select2 |>  mutate(DoublePL = 2*Petal.Length) |> head()')
  Hint: Try data_select2 |>  mutate(DoublePL = Petal.Length*2 ) |> head(). 

# case_when()
- Class: script
  Output: Let's learn another function, case_when(), which is helpful when doing more complex mutations. Again, we've loaded a script for you. When you're ready to submit, save your script and type submit(). 
  AnswerTests: script_results_identical('data_select2')
  Hint: Use skip() if you're stuck.
  Script: casewhen.R
  
#mean() and rowwise() ? do it wrong first
- Class: cmd_question 
  Output: In Psychology, we love to make averages of things - multiple questions averaged together on a scale to get an average score, for example. mutate() handles that. Let's pipe data_select2 into mutate(), and then we'll create a new variable called Sepal.Avg which we will set equal to the mean() function, where we will pass through that function the list (c() ) of Sepal.Width and Sepal.Length. Once that is done, pipe that into head() so we can see our results.
  CorrectAnswer: data_select2 |>  mutate( Sepal.Avg = mean(c(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width))) |> head()
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('data_select2 |>  mutate( Sepal.Avg = mean(c(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width))) |> head()', 'data_select2 |>  mutate( Sepal.Avg = mean(c(Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length))) |> head()')
  Hint: Try data_select2 |>  mutate( Sepal.Avg = mean(c(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width))) |> head()

- Class: text
  Output: Uh oh! Our average is the same per observation! That's because we didn't tell R to think in terms of rows, so it's currently thinking about the data as a whole. 
  
# test to see if I can switch the order?
- Class: cmd_question 
  Output:  There is a quick fix to this. Hit the up arrow key to get to your last answer. Before mutate(...), we need to add one additional pipe function, rowwise(), and then pipe that into mutate. At that point (Where now it reads -- take our data, and then, consider it by row, and then mutate...), we'll be good to go! Try that now. 
  CorrectAnswer: data_select2 |>  rowwise() |> mutate( Sepal.Avg = mean(c(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width))) |> head()
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('data_select2 |> rowwise() |> mutate(Sepal.Avg = mean(c(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width))) |> head()', 'data_select2 |>  rowwise() |> mutate(Sepal.Avg = mean(c(Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length))) |> head()')
  Hint: Try data_select2 |>  rowwise() |> mutate(Sepal.Avg = mean(c(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width))) |> head()
#summarise
- Class: cmd_question 
  Output:  We might want to say, "Well, what is the average of this across the data set"? While mutate() creates new variables, summarise() can create new datasets that have summarised variables based on our specifications. Like mutate(), it takes things in terms of NewVariable = WayToCalculateIt. Pipe data_select2 into summarise() to calculate the mean of the Sepal.Width variable, and call this meanSW (for mean Sepal.Width).
  CorrectAnswer: data_select2 |>  summarise(meanSW = mean(Sepal.Width))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data_select2 |>  summarise(meanSW = mean(Sepal.Width))')
  Hint: Try data_select2 |>  summarise(meanSW = mean(Sepal.Width))
  
#group_by()
- Class: cmd_question 
  Output: That's nice (and can be helpful when reporting things like scale means in the methods section). But what if we want to know what each group's average is? Like rowwise(), there is a function we can put in between data_select2 and summarise(), and it is called group_by(). Hit the up arrow, and add group_by() between your pipe where the one argument in group_by() will be our Species variable. 
  CorrectAnswer: data_select2 |>  group_by(Species) |> summarise(meanSW = mean(Sepal.Width))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data_select2 |>  group_by(Species) |> summarise(meanSW = mean(Sepal.Width))')
  Hint: Try data_select2 |>  group_by(Species) |> summarise(meanSW = mean(Sepal.Width))

#30

- Class: text
  Output: The notes walk through how to expand on summarise() to get you standard deviations and standard errors.

- Class: text
  Output: We also want to note that rowwise() and group_by() make underlying changes to the data. The notes walk through some critical examples of this behavior. If you ever re-save your data after grouping (data <- data |> group_by()), you will need to eventually ungroup() that data to bring it back to normal (data <- data |> ungroup()).

#arrange
- Class: cmd_question 
  Output: Hit up on your keyboard. Add one more pipe at the end of this sentence, and then pass the verb arrange() with the single argument meanSW. 
  CorrectAnswer: data_select2 |>  group_by(Species) |> summarise(meanSW = mean(Sepal.Width)) |> arrange(meanSW)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data_select2 |>  group_by(Species) |> summarise(meanSW = mean(Sepal.Width)) |> arrange(meanSW)')
  Hint: Try data_select2 |>  group_by(Species) |> summarise(meanSW = mean(Sepal.Width)) |> arrange(meanSW)
  
- Class: text
  Output: That's it! There's a lot you can do with the tidyverse library. We hope that was helpful.

#34
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Would you like to submit the log of this lesson to Google Forms so that your instructor may evaluate your progress?
  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  CorrectAnswer: NULL
  AnswerTests: submit_log()
  Hint: hint
