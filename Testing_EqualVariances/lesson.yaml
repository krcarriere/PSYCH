  Output: You may want to exit() if you have not first reviewed your basics on GGPlot, specifically on the violin plot and facet_grid(). 

- Class: text
  Output: Many of our parametric tests come with the assumption that each group we are analyzing has the same variance. We also can expand this definition when we turn to regressions, where we are assuming that the variance remains the same across the range of values.

- Class: text
  Output: This can be a tricky assumption to meet.
  
- Class: text
  Output: How do we examine whether or not this assumption is made?
  
- Class: text
  Output: The most basic way, especially when simply considering the variance between two groups, is to use the F Test, where we check the ratio between the variance of Group 1 and the variance of Group 2. If they are equal, the ratio between them should be 1. A short rule of thumb is that if the variance ratio is >3, you probably have some inequality between the variances of groups.
  
- Class: text
  Output: However, the F Test is very sensitive to outliers and non-normality, so we consider it only as a first check.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Instead, we will use 'the best' test of testing non-normality, Levene's Test. However, it should be noted that Levene's Test also has its problems - it has very low power with low sample sizes and struggles when sample sizes are very uneven (c.f. Nordstrokke & Zumbo, 2007).

  Output: In 2022, Frankenhuis and colleagues wanted to know whether or not individuals who lived in relatively challenging conditions were significantly different in a range of measures compared to those who lived in low-risk situations, with their primary research question measuring if those who were high-risk detected more threats in ambiguous situations compared to a low-risk group.
  
- Class: text
  Output: The high-risk group was a "group of community participants who lived in relatively challenging conditions for Dutch standards, in that people were more likely to need governmental support to meet their basic needs (e.g., food, housing, safety)." They had "anticipated that on average members of the community sample had experienced higher levels of adversity, including higher levels of exposure to violence in their past or current environments. The other group was a college student sample, who [were] expected to have experienced lower levels of violence (the ‘low-risk group’)". We've loaded their data in your environment under data.

  Output: Look at the data now by running data |> summary().
  CorrectAnswer: data |> summary()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data |> summary()')
  Hint: Try data |> summary()

- Class: mult_question
  Output: How many total variables are in this dataset?
  AnswerChoices: 7; 6; 127; 4
  CorrectAnswer: 7
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='7')
  Hint: Look in your Environment tab.

- Class: text
  Output: Great job. So, there are seven variables. We will, for now, look primarily at risk_group (whether or not the participants were either high-risk or low-risk) and poverty_dev (whether they had their basic needs met in their past, measured on a 1-7 scale, where seven is having all of their needs met and one is not having their needs met.). 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Our first step when given a dataset should be visualizing it. Let us use ggplot2 to plot a violin plot. To do this, remember to take our data data, and pipe (|>) it into ggplot(). ggplot() takes one argument, aes(), which itself takes two arguments, our variables. Our y variable (y) should be equal to (=) poverty_dev and our x variable (x) will be our explanatory variable equal to (=) risk_group. After that, add (+) a layer called geom_violin(). 
  CorrectAnswer: data |> ggplot(aes(x=risk_group, y=poverty_dev))+geom_violin()
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('data |> ggplot(aes(x=risk_group, y=poverty_dev))+geom_violin()', 'data %>% ggplot(aes(x=risk_group, y=poverty_dev)) + geom_violin()')
  Hint: data |> ggplot(aes(x=risk_group, y=poverty_dev))+geom_violin()

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What group looks like it has a larger variance than the other?
  AnswerChoices: High-risk group; Low-risk group
  CorrectAnswer: High-risk group
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='High-risk group')
  Hint: Which of the two has a larger spread in the data? 
  
- Class: text
  Output: Indeed! They look pretty different in their variances. This may suggest that there are differences in the variances. So, visually, we should be concerned.
  
- Class: text
  Output: There are a few ways to quantify this difference. In this Module, we will consider Levene's Test. Levene's tests the null hypothesis that the variances are homogeneous - that there is no difference between the variances of the groups. 

#20
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To use this test, we can use the function levene_test() in the rstatix package. To run this test, pipe the data into levene_test(). The first argument in the function is the equation we are interested in testing, written by our response variable ~ explanatory variable. Try it now.
  CorrectAnswer: data |> levene_test(poverty_dev ~ risk_group)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data |> levene_test(poverty_dev ~ risk_group)')
  Hint: Put the following in your console -  data |> levene_test(poverty_dev ~ risk_group)
  
- Class: text
  Output: So we can see that this test's df1 (1) represents k-1, where K is the number of groups. df2 (125) represents N-k, where N is the number of observations, and k is the number of groups. Our test statistic, 9.70, is tested against an F distribution with (1,125) degrees of freedom. That gives a p-value of .00229.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What do you conclude about this data, given an alpha of .05?
  AnswerChoices: We reject the null hypothesis - there is evidence their variances are different; We reject the null hypothesis - there is evidence their variances are the same; We fail to reject the null hypothesis - there is evidence their variances are different;  We fail to reject the null hypothesis - there is evidence their variances are different.
  CorrectAnswer: We reject the null hypothesis - there is evidence their variances are different
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='We reject the null hypothesis - there is evidence their variances are different')
  Hint: Is the p-value less than an alpha of .05?

- Class: text
  Output: Exactly. The researchers astutely noticed this as well, so they proceeded with Welch's T-Test, a specific type that does not assume the variances are equal.

- Class: text
  Output: We can do Levene's Test on more than just two groups. 

- Class: text
  Output: In another study, researchers wanted to replicate and extend a paper from 2004. In their 2022 study, they present participants with someone looking for help to load a sofa into a van. Some participants were told that if someone were to help the person, that helper would receive 50 cents ($0.50), which they called a low cash payment. Others were told the helper would receive $5, which they called a medium cash payment. Others were told that the helper would not receive a payment for helping (With mention of control), and others were told nothing about the payment (Without mention of control). They also tested to see if it was sweets (candy or chocolate) instead of cash, but we won't analyze those. Based on this information, participants were asked how much they expected people to help this poor sofa-moving soul.
  
- Class: text
  Output: They had a hypothesis -  The expected willingness to help in the nonpayment condition is higher than in the low monetary payment condition.

  Output: We've also loaded their dataset in your environment, called df2. Run df2 |> summary() to learn more about it.
  CorrectAnswer: df2 |> summary()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='df2 |> summary()')
  Hint: df2 |> summary()

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To understand the variables, let's tabulate using table() on the Condition variable.  To do this, take our data, df2, and then (|>) select() the variable we want to look at, Condition, and then (|>) use the table() function.
  CorrectAnswer: df2 |> select(Condition) |> table()
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('df2 |> select(Condition) |> table()', 'df2 %>% select(Condition) %>% table()', 'df2 %>% select(Condition) %>% table', 'table(df2$Condition)')
  Hint: One way to do it would be to write df2 |> select(Condition) |> table(), or you can write table(df2$Condition).
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Now, we won't look at the results here (but they did find that not being told the chance of money had participants report higher expectations of help compared to the low money condition). Instead, they used Welch's ANOVA - a specific kind of ANOVA that does not assume homogeneity of variances! "
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "They write: In the pre-registration, we did not explicitly mention whether we would use a conventional Fisher’s or Welch’s ANOVA. However, given that Levene’s test indicated that the assumption of equal variance was violated (F(3, 1097) = 3.77, p = .01)...." \n\n "Can we replicate this result? Let us try what we've learned on this dataset, running Expected ~ Condition through levene_test() and piping the df2 on the left-hand side."
  CorrectAnswer: df2 |> levene_test(Expected ~ Condition)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='df2 |> levene_test(Expected ~ Condition)')
  Hint: df2 |> levene_test(Expected ~ Condition)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Uh oh! That is not what they had. While our df1 (3) and df2 (1097) are the same, our test statistics (3.77 v 0.827) and p values (p=.01 v. p=.479) are different. We might wonder what is going on. Let's pull up the help file of levene_test().
  CorrectAnswer: ?levene_test
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('?levene_test', '?levene_test()')
  Hint: ?levene_test

- Class: text
  Output: See how the third argument is called center; its default value is median. The description states that the mean gives the original Levene's Test results, but the median is more robust. Did the authors choose the original test?

- Class: text
  Output: "As a reminder, they write: In the pre-registration, we did not explicitly mention whether we would use a conventional Fisher’s or Welch’s ANOVA. However, given that Levene’s test indicated that the assumption of equal variance was violated (F(3, 1097) = 3.77, p = .01)."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Let's try that again, but this time, inside of levene_test(), pass a second argument after Expected ~ Condition to set center equal to mean. On the left hand side, continue to pipe the dataset, df2."
  CorrectAnswer: df2 |> levene_test(Expected ~ Condition, center=mean)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='df2 |> levene_test(Expected ~ Condition, center=mean)')
  Hint: df2 |> levene_test(Expected ~ Condition, center=mean)

- Class: text
  Output: It looks like they did! Great job.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Now, Levene's Test has its own set of limitations. Levene's Test is sensitive to sample size and will more easily be able to reject when sample size is large. You should make your judgement call on deciding how big of a sample is enough. 

- Class: text
  Output: Also, as we saw, there are differences between what kind of test you are running even within Levene's - are we testing the means or the medians? The center being set to the median is generally preferred when you have a clear skewed distribution of your Y variable within a group. In contrast, the mean is preferred for symmetrically tailed distributions.

- Class: text
  Output: Before we toss this analysis to the side, we should check to see if the data, per group, is relatively symmetrical or if there is a skew. It may be that the authors were correct in their analysis of Levene's Test and using the mean *if* there is no skew. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can check this by plotting our data. Let us pass our data frame, df2, into a ggplot() call, where we want the aes() x value to be Expected. We will add onto that call that we want to plot geom_histogram() and that we also want to facet_wrap(~Condition). 
  CorrectAnswer: df2 |> ggplot(aes(x=Expected))+geom_histogram()+facet_wrap(~Condition)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='df2 |> ggplot(aes(x=Expected))+geom_histogram()+facet_wrap(~Condition)')
  Hint: df2 |> ggplot(aes(x=Expected))+geom_histogram()+facet_wrap(~Condition)

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which group has a strong skew?
  AnswerChoices: Low cash; Medium cash; With mention; without mention; None; All
  CorrectAnswer: Low cash
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Low cash')
  Hint: Only one of the four groups shows a strong positive skew. Which one?

- Class: text
  Output: Indeed. This is too bad because as we saw, the difference between center=mean and center=median was quite significant! Because there was a skew, we should have set center=median. That would have led us to fail to reject the null hypothesis that there were differences in variance between groups, and the authors should have continued with a standard one-way ANOVA.

- Class: text
  Output: "Still, we can commonly apply this test to our lessons. We also can consider the heteroscedasticity of regression error terms. "

- Class: text
  Output: "For example, in the original dataset, we could try to estimate one of their study's dependent variables. As the authors write, C represents the threshold for recognizing a signal (i.e., fight) trial: a c of zero indicates no bias, a negative c a low threshold (fight bias; consistent with hostile attribution bias, and a positive c a high threshold (no-fight bias; consistent with rose-colored glasses.  We could try and predict an individual's bias to perceive fights (C) by both their current and past basic needs (poverty_current) and (poverty_dev) and one's involvement in violence as a youth (YRB_dev)."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "I have created the linear model that estimates this already in your environment. Run summary(cLM) to see it."
  CorrectAnswer: summary(cLM)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(cLM)')
  Hint: Write summary(cLM)

- Class: text
  Output: Nice job!

- Class: text
  Output: Remember, the simplest explanation of a regression is trying to draw a line of best fit through a scatterplot. We use these coefficients to estimate what our data says is our most expected observation, given specific values. We call this the "fitted" value. But these fitted values differ from the truth - what our data shows. We call that distance from the estimated line to the actual points of the residuals.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can pass cLM into ggplot(), naming the aes() for x to be .fitted and y to be .resid. Add on a point geom (geom_point()) after the ggplot call.
  CorrectAnswer: cLM |> ggplot(aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid))+geom_point()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='cLM |> ggplot(aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid))+geom_point()')
  Hint: cLM |> ggplot(aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid))+geom_point()
  
- Class: text
  Output: You should review the regression module for more information, but there is a clear < spreading pattern in this case. The residuals grow in size as we move across the x-axis. This funnel shape is a good sign that we might have heteroskedasticity - that the variance is not the same across all levels of X.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The library lmtest has a function called bptest(). This stands for the Breusch-Pagan Test, a test for the heteroscedasticity of residuals if given a model. Pass our model, cLM, into bptest().
  CorrectAnswer: bptest(cLM)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='bptest(cLM)')
  Hint: bptest(cLM)

- Class: text
  Output: And indeed we do! Since we reject the null hypothesis that there is homoscedasticity, evidence suggests that our residuals are indeed heteroskedastic. We might defer to using *robust* standard errors.

- Class: text
  Output: "And now we've tested homogeneity of variances in multiple ways - using levene_test() for categorical-focused models, and using bptest() to test the residuals of linear models. We considered how Levene's can be based on both the mean (good if not skewed) or median (robust and able to handle skewed data), but also reflected on Levene's limitations. In various other modules, we also address how some of our models are robust themselves to these violations (like ANOVA), while others can easily be addressed (robust standard errors)."
