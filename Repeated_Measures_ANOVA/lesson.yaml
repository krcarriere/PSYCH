- Class: text
  Output: This module will expand what we have discussed in the One-Way ANOVA [Within] module to consider ANOVAs with multiple factors, where at least one of the factors is repeated. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: "There are numerous assumptions of a within-subjects or repeated measures ANOVA."
#9
- Class: text
  Output: "They are as follows - \n\n (1) Compound Symmetry - The correlation between repeated measures for each participant remains constant. \n\n (2) Sphericity - The differences between any two time points are the same, irrespective of how distant the measurements are. \n\n (3) Observations within each combination of factors are randomly sampled from the population and independent from other observations within the group."

#10
- Class: text
  Output: "\n\n(4) The observations within each combination are normally distributed (5) with no significant outliers. \n\n (6) Time intervals are equally spaced out." 

#11
- Class: text
  Output: "(7) All subjects are measured at all time intervals, with no missing, not at random. \n\n (8) Response variables generally must be categorical."

#12
- Class: text
  Output: "The ones we will focus most on in this module are (4) Combinations are normally distributed, \n\n (5) No significant outliers, with caution, and (2) Sphericity."


#14 - 
- Class: text
  Output: "We have loaded up a dataset for you from a paper we examined in the Testing Equal Variances and our Pivoting Data module. \n\nResearchers wanted to replicate and extend a paper from 2004. In their 2022 study, they present participants with someone looking for help to load a sofa into a van. Some participants were told that if someone were to help the person, that helper would receive 50 cents ($0.50), which they called a low cash payment. Others were told the helper would receive $5, which they called a medium cash payment. Others were told that the helper would not receive a payment for helping (With mention of control), and others were told nothing about the payment (Without mention of control). They also tested to see if it was sweets (candy or chocolate) instead of cash, but we won't analyze those. Based on this information, participants were asked how much they expected people to help this poor sofa-moving soul."

#16
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's examine the data by piping the dataset, HeymanLong, into the head() function, but add the number 10 as an argument into head(). This will show us ten rows of the dataset instead of 6.
  CorrectAnswer: HeymanLong |> head(10)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='HeymanLong |> head(10)')
  Hint: Enter HeymanLong |> head(10) into your console.

#17
- Class: text
  Output: "We can see that there are four columns. One, ReponseId, reflects an anonymous tag of the participant. We can see that each participant is observed six times, because there are six rows for each ResponseId. This is called the long data format, and is the best way to have the data set up since each row reflects one observation of one person."

#18
- Class: text
  Output: "There seem to be two categorical variables - PayLevel and PayForm, with PayLevel having two levels (Low and Medium) and PayForm having three levels (Candy, Cash, Monetized Candy). Finally, there is our response variable of interest, PWH, or perceived willingness to help."

#19
- Class: exact_question
  Output: "Our first assumption to check is normality within each group pair. Since it is a 3 (PayForm) x 2 (PayLevel) model, we should expect how many groups? Enter the whole number into your Console."
  CorrectAnswer: 6
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='6')
  Hint: To solve for the number of groups, multiply the factors together.

#20
- Class: text
  Output: "You should already have some background knowledge for how we can test for (4) -  The observations within each combination are normally distributed -  if you haven't, be sure to review Testing For Nonnormality."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Take our dataset, HeymanLong, and pipe (|>) it into group_by(), where we want to specify we have two grouping variables, PayLevel, PayForm, and then pipe (|>) that into shapiro_test() from the rstatix package, passing the argument PWH as our response variable. "
  CorrectAnswer: HeymanLong |> group_by(PayLevel, PayForm) |> shapiro_test(PWH)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='HeymanLong |> group_by(PayLevel, PayForm) |> shapiro_test(PWH)')
  Hint: "HeymanLong |> group_by(PayLevel, PayForm) |> shapiro_test(PWH)"

#21 -
- Class: text
  Output: "Great job. This might look bad, but ANOVAs can be relatively robust to violations of the normality assumption. We recommend reading Schmider, E., Ziegler, M., Danay, E., Beyer, L., Bühner, M. (2010) for more information. Is it really robust? Reinvestigating the robustness of ANOVA against violations of the normal distribution assumption. Methodology, 6(4), 147-151."
  
#22
- Class: text
  Output: "However, since they all are rejected, we should at least be slightly cautious. We can test to see if significant outliers per group may be causing this problem."

#23
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "We can also do this using rstatix. Hit up on your console. Where you had shapiro_wilk(PWH), change that to identify_outliers(PWH)."
  CorrectAnswer: HeymanLong |> group_by(PayLevel, PayForm) |> identify_outliers(PWH)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='HeymanLong |> group_by(PayLevel, PayForm) |> identify_outliers(PWH)')
  Hint: HeymanLong |> group_by(PayLevel, PayForm) |> identify_outliers(PWH)

#24
- Class: text
  Output: "identify_outliers() defines an outlier as any value above the 3rd quartile + 1.5 times the interquartile range (or 1st Q minus 1.5IQR), and extreme outliers are +/- 3*IQR."

#25
- Class: text
  Output: The helpfile notes, and we agree entirely, that "data points that are labeled outliers in boxplots are not considered as troublesome as those considered extreme points and might even be ignored." 
  
#26
- Class: text
  Output: "Since no extreme outliers exist, our data seems okay to assumption (5). We recommend never removing observations that are true for is.outlier but false for is.extreme, but researchers may find justification for removing outliers that are true for is.extreme, but even then, we recommend caution against risks of p-hacking and Type I errors, see Bakker, M., & Wicherts, J. M. (2014). Outlier removal, sum scores, and the inflation of the type I error rate in independent samples t-tests- The power of alternatives and recommendations. Psychological Methods, 19(3), 409–427. doi.org/10.1037/met0000014" 
  
#27
- Class: text
  Output: "Our last assumption is that of sphericity. Again, the rstatix library will come to the rescue. The authors, when reporting their results, state - We first carried out a 3 (payment form: cash vs. candy vs. monetized candy)  x 2 (payment level: low vs. medium) within-subject ANOVA on the expected willingness to help (see Figure 1 for descriptive statistics). Mauchly’s test revealed that the assumption of sphericity was violated for the main effect of the payment form and the interaction term."

#28
- Class: text
  Output: "It should be noted that Sphericity can only be tested if the number of groups > 2. Since we're testing the variance between any two-time points, it states that the variance in T1-T3 is the same as in T2-T3 is the same as in T1-T2. With only two time points or groups, there's nothing to compare against."
  
#29
- Class: script
  Output: Let's use anova_test() to learn more about our results and the results reported by the authors. We've loaded a script for you to play with. When you're ready, type submit().
  AnswerTests: script_results_identical('pwh_anova')
  Hint: "Does yours look like this -  HeymanLong |> anova_test(dv=PWH, wid=ResponseId, within=c(PayLevel, PayForm)) ? "
  Script: mauchley.R
  
#30
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's print out our ANOVA results now by typing pwh_anova.
  CorrectAnswer: pwh_anova
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='pwh_anova')
  Hint: Write pwh_anova now.
  
#31:
- Class: text
  Output: We can see three main outputs, signified by $. The second one is $'Mauchly's Test for Sphericity.' Both PayForm (remember, three levels), and the moderating effect of PayLevel on PayForm (6 possible levels) are significant. We reject the null hypothesis that the variances between two timepoints are the same. The statistic reported, W (it should be epsilon) ranges from 0 to 1, where larger is better.
  
#32:
- Class: text
  Output: The general rule of thumb is if epsilon is greater than .75, we can use what is known as Huynh-Feldt corrections, but if it's less than .75, we should use Greenhouse-Geisser corrections. GG corrections are more conservative, so sometimes authors will opt to be as conservative as possible in their analyses. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: The authors write, "and we employed Greenhouse-Geisser corrected degrees of freedom, " though the epsilon suggests they did not have to do that.
  
- Class: text
  Output: How can we employ this correction?
  
- Class: script
  Output: We will pipe our anova_test() function into a complementary function get_anova_table() and pass along inside of that the argument correction="GG."  When you're ready, type submit().
  AnswerTests: script_results_identical('pwh_anova')
  Hint: 'Does yours look like this -  HeymanLong |> anova_test(dv=PWH, wid=ResponseId, within=c(PayLevel, PayForm)) |> get_anova_table(correction="GG") ? '
  Script: correction.R
 
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You know the drill - let's see our results now with pwh_anova. 
  CorrectAnswer: pwh_anova
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='pwh_anova')
  Hint: Write pwh_anova now.

- Class: text
  Output: First, we want to notice what happened (scroll up to compare). The DFd and DFn changed, but the F stat stayed the same. However, the slight change in the DFd/DFn makes a change in the F critical value.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To show this, let's determine the f critical value for uncorrected PayForm. Using qf(), pass the alpha/2 (.025), the DFn (2), the DFd (1996), and lower.tail=FALSE.
  CorrectAnswer: qf(.025, 2, 1996, lower.tail=FALSE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='qf(.025, 2, 1996, lower.tail=FALSE)')
  Hint: Write qf(.025, 2, 1996, lower.tail=FALSE)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Compare this to the f critical of our corrected PayForm. Using qf(), pass the alpha/2 (.025), the DFn (1.76), the DFd (1752.32), and lower.tail=FALSE.
  CorrectAnswer: qf(.025, 1.76, 1752.32, lower.tail=FALSE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='qf(.025, 1.76, 1752.32, lower.tail=FALSE)')
  Hint: Write qf(.025, 1.76, 1752.32, lower.tail=FALSE).
  
- Class: text
  Output: Since our corrected critical value is larger than our non-corrected, we make it slightly more difficult for ourselves to reject the null hypothesis due to the violations of sphericity.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's remind us of what the results were - type in pwh_anova again.
  CorrectAnswer: pwh_anova
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='pwh_anova')
  Hint: Write pwh_anova now.

- Class: text
  Output: "The authors write - We found a large effect for the payment form, F(1.76, 1752.33) = 161.56, p .001, η2p  = .14, 90% CI [.12, .16]. The main effect of the payment level was also large,  F(1, 998) = 1679.32, p .001, η2p  = .63, 90% CI [.60, .65]. Finally, we found an interaction effect,   F(1.90, 1900.34) = 428.58, p .001, η2p  = .30, 90% CI [.27, .33], supporting H1."

- Class: text
  Output: "We've gotten most of that! The only part we haven't been able to get yet is the partial eta squared reported (that n2p = .14) and the 90% CI of the partial eta squared."
  
- Class: script
  Output: We will add onto our anova_test() function to ask for the partial eta squared effect sizes.  When you're ready, type submit().
  AnswerTests: script_results_identical('pwh_anova')
  Hint: 'Does yours look like this -  HeymanLong |> anova_test(dv=PWH, wid=ResponseId, within=c(PayLevel, PayForm), effect.size="pes") |> get_anova_table(correction="GG") ? '
  Script: fullanova.R
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You know the drill - let's see our results now with pwh_anova. 
  CorrectAnswer: pwh_anova
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='pwh_anova')
  Hint: Write pwh_anova now.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: anova_test() cannot give us the 90% CI of partial eta squared. However, we can use the get.ci.partial.eta.squared() function from apaTables. Let's demonstrate the effect size CI for  PayLevel:PayForm. The function wants four arguments - the F statistic (F.value=428.576), the DFn (df1=1.90), the DFd (df2=1900.34), and the confidence interval (conf.level=.90). 
  CorrectAnswer: get.ci.partial.eta.squared(F.value=428.576, df1=1.90, df2=1900.34, conf.level=.90)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='get.ci.partial.eta.squared(F.value=428.576, df1=1.90, df2=1900.34, conf.level=.90)')
  Hint: get.ci.partial.eta.squared(F.value=428.576, df1=1.90, df2=1900.34, conf.level=.90)
