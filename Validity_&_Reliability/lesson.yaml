#1
- Class: text
  Output: Welcome to this third class. Today, we're going to talk about how we can understand different operational definitions.

#2
- Class: text
  Output: We want to be able to ask whether or not a given way to measure something is a good way to measure it.
#3
- Class: text
  Output: For example, while we could theoretically measure your heart rate as an operational definition of IQ, that probably would make very little sense and would not be correct.
#4
- Class: text
  Output: So, a measure must be both
#5  
- Class: text
  Output: Reliable - It can provide consistent results each time it is administered, regardless of who is administering it.
#6  
- Class: text
  Output: and
#7  
- Class: text
  Output: Valid - The measure accurately accesses what it claims to measure.
  
#8

- Class: mult_question
  Output: So, is heart rate a reliable measure for IQ?
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No;I don't know 
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Yes")
  Hint: Think - if someone took your heart rate right now, and then tomorrow someone else completely different took your heart rate, would they come out similarly? There is a trick here too - reliability we don't care WHAT we are measuring, just that we are measuring.

#9
- Class: mult_question
  Output: So, is heart rate a valid measure for IQ?
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No;I don't know 
  CorrectAnswer: No
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="No")
  Hint: Does heart rate in your opinion relate to IQ? Can we claim someone's heart rate is related to how smart they are?
  

#10
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Great. Another example. Say you have a 10 pound bowling bowl. You put it on a scale, and it reads 20 pounds. You take it off, clean the top, and place it down again. It reads 20 pounds again. \n\n Is this scale reliable, valid, both, or neither?"
  AnswerChoices: Reliable but not valid;Valid but not reliable;Neither reliable nor valid;Reliable and valid 
  CorrectAnswer: Reliable but not valid
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Reliable but not valid")
  Hint: Remember, reliability is consistency, while validity is accuracy.

#11
- Class: text
  Output: "First, let's break down reliability. In this class, we will focus on 3 types of reliability. They are: \n\n Interrater reliability \n\n Test-retest reliability \n\n and \n\n Internal consistency reliability "
  
#12
- Class: text
  Output: "Interrater reliability is when extent to which two or more observers rate the same subject the same way."

#13
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Type head(data) to look at some fake data. It has three columns, one of the participant, and two scores from two separate people."
  CorrectAnswer: head(data)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(data)')
  Hint: Type 'head(data)' without quotes. 

- Class: text
  Output: "The first row is a list of participant IDs - each is a different person. The next two rows are scores given by two different graders. So, for example, Student 1 received a 7 from both Rater1 and Rater2."

#14
- Class: text
  Output: "In this example, you would conclude that the raters had about 80% agreement - they disagreed on the score of student 5."
  
#15
- Class: text
  Output: "Test-retest reliability is testing the same measure on the same participant multiple times. Typically, we like about .80 correlation, but that number is debated and usually anything above .7 is still publishable."

#16
- Class: text
  Output: "Internal consistency reliability measures the agreement on different items of the same test. The point is that your participants should agree with similar things provided they are all measuring the same thing."
#17
- Class: text
  Output: "We usually use a statistic called Cronbachs alpha here. Again, .70 is acceptable, but .80 is good too."
#18
- Class: text
  Output: "For example, we could ask- How much do you like this person, how likely are you to hang out with this person, how much would you want to play another game with this person -- and hope all three questions are getting at the overall question of the amount you like a person."

#19
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Pop quiz! Type 'graph1'."
  CorrectAnswer: graph1
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='graph1')
  Hint: Type 'graph1' without quotes. 

#20
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "What would you say this is?"
  AnswerChoices: High reliability and low validity;Low reliability and high validity;Low reliability and low validity;High reliability and high validity 
  CorrectAnswer: High reliability and low validity
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="High reliability and low validity")
  Hint: Remember, reliability is consistency, while validity is accuracy (and the bulleye is what we are aiming for).
  
#21
- Class: text
  Output: "Next is validity. Specifically, we are looking at our construct validity - how valid is it to use heart rate for intelligence."

#22
- Class: text
  Output: "A measure cannot be valid unless it is reliable, but a measure can be reliable without being a valid measure of the variable of interest."
  
#23
- Class: text
  Output: "But - how can we prove that heart rate isn't a valid measure of IQ?"

#24
- Class: text
  Output: "We can measure their intelligence in a different way as well. If they both preform equally at predicting IQ, then that would give us some proof that heart rate is related to IQ. \n\n On the other hand, if the other test was predicting IQ much better than heart rate, we could infer that maybe heart rate isn't the best at predicting IQ."
  
#25
- Class: text
  Output: "There are other things that can influence our validity. Imagine if we had an IQ test that was - \n\n 2+2=? \n\n 3+2=? \n\n 10+4=?. \n\n It would definitely be reliable, but it wouldn't be valid."

#26
- Class: text
  Output: "This is called ceiling effects - our scale is clearly restricted on the upper bounds and doesnt provide the full range of answers we'd like to see."

- Class: text
  Output: "It is restricted to upper values because it would be very hard not to do well on this quiz. So, we'd probably not see people fail this quiz. Instead, everyone would score a 100."

#27
- Class: text
  Output: "We also could do the opposite - make our IQ test so hard that you couldn't get any of it right."

#28
- Class: text
  Output: "This is called floor effects - our scale is clearly restricted on the lower bounds and doesnt provide the full range of answers we'd like to see."

- Class: text
  Output: "Both of these effects (Floor and Ceiling) are generally referred to as attenuation of the scale effects."

#29
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Pop quiz! Type 'graph2'."
  CorrectAnswer: graph2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='graph2')
  Hint: Type 'graph2' without quotes. 

#30
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "What would you say this is?"
  AnswerChoices: High reliability and low validity;Low reliability and high validity;Low reliability and low validity;High reliability and high validity 
  CorrectAnswer: Low reliability and low validity
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Low reliability and low validity")
  Hint: Remember, reliability is consistency, while validity is accuracy (and the bulleye is what we are aiming for).
  
#31
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Pop quiz! Type 'graph3'."
  CorrectAnswer: graph3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='graph3')
  Hint: Type 'graph3' without quotes. 

#32
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "What would you say this is?"
  AnswerChoices: High reliability and low validity;Low reliability and high validity;Low reliability and low validity;High reliability and high validity 
  CorrectAnswer: High reliability and high validity
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="High reliability and high validity")
  Hint: Remember, reliability is consistency, while validity is accuracy (and the bulleye is what we are aiming for).
  
- Class: text
  Output: "That's the end! Now, I just want to leave you with a final note."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "It will always be impossible to measure things with absolute certainty - and that's okay! We want to respect the fact different people respond to things in different ways."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "It's also very hard to measure exactly what we want to measure as psychologists. It is up to you, as a researcher, to provide strong theoretical reasons why you think heart rate is a good measure of IQ, and, it is for us, as readers, to debate and critically consider if they are measuring what they think they are measuring."
