#1
- Class: text
  Output: "Welcome to this class. Today, we're going to continue our discussion on validity."
#2

- Class: text
  Output: "We will discuss the differences of internal and external validity."

#3
- Class: text
  Output: "Internal validity focuses on how valid our study itself was."

#4
- Class: text
  Output: "External validity focuses on how well we can generalize our results to the greater population."

#
- Class: text
  Output: "A threat to internal validity would then be something that makes the groups we create different beyond our own manipulations."
#
- Class: text
  Output: "A threat to external validity would be something that makes our sample somehow different then the target population we wish to generalize outwards to."


#5
- Class: text
  Output: "Imagine we had a world of only three eye colors - blue, green, and brown. And we have this super-mega intelligence drug. We want to see if it'll work - so we want to give some participants our drug and see if it makes them smarter."

#6
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "So, let's see what this world looks like. Type plot1."
  CorrectAnswer: plot1
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot1')
  Hint: Type 'plot1' without quotes.

#7
- Class: text
  Output: "Great! Now, remember, in our world, the only differences between people is eye color, and (hopefully) our drug working. So, how can we test our drug?"

#8
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "One way we can split this world up is to to take a few of the blue eyed people, a few of the green eyed people, and give them either a drug or not. Type plot2 to see how this would look."
  CorrectAnswer: plot2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot2')
  Hint: Type 'plot2' without quotes. 

#9
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Is doing something like this interally valid, externally valid, both, or neither?"
  AnswerChoices: Internally valid;Externally valid;Both internally valid and externally valid;Neither internally valid nor externally valid 
  CorrectAnswer: Internally valid
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Internally valid")
  Hint: Interval validity means we have controlled for everything we can. Externally valid means we can generalize out to the greater population. 

#10
- Class: text
  Output: "Exactly. While there would be good internal validity to this study (you can see eye color is relatively controlled), it would not be externally valid because we forgot about the brown eye individuals!"

#11
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "So, we can fix this problem by adding in the brown eyes into the study. Type plot3."
  CorrectAnswer: plot3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot3')
  Hint: Type 'plot3' without quotes. 

#12
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Is doing something like this interally valid, externally valid, both, or neither?"
  AnswerChoices: Externally valid;Externally valid;Both internally valid and externally valid;Neither internally valid nor externally valid 
  CorrectAnswer: Externally valid
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Externally valid")
  Hint: Interval validity means we have controlled for everything we can. Externally valid means we can generalize out to the greater population. 

#13
- Class: text
  Output: "We've added all three groups into our study, which is good!  But now we still have a problem - while brown is in both groups, what about blue and green eyes? Maybe green-eyed people are somehow smarter by default than blue-eyed people, so we're not sure if the differences are because of eye color, or because of the drug!"

#14
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Let's try one more way to look at this world. Type plot4."
  CorrectAnswer: plot4
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot4')
  Hint: Type 'plot4' without quotes. 

#15
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Is doing something like this interally valid, externally valid, both, or neither?"
  AnswerChoices: Externally valid;Externally valid;Both internally valid and externally valid;Neither internally valid nor externally valid 
  CorrectAnswer: Both internally valid and externally valid
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Both internally valid and externally valid")
  Hint: Interval validity means we have controlled for everything we can. Externally valid means we can generalize out to the greater population. 
  
#16
- Class: text
  Output: "Exactly! Now we have equal groups of eye color, so the only difference in the world is if they receive the drug or not."

#17
- Class: text
  Output: "Of course, in the real world, there are infinite number of differences between people. That's why we must be extra-careful about how we design and control our studies! \n\n Many of these issues can be dealt with random assignment, which we will discuss later. However, there are other ways in which our validity can be threatened."

#18
- Class: text
  Output: "Imagine we are offering a free course for the community in how you should interact with the police at traffic stops. 50 people show up and complete the course. We then check back with those 50 people 6 months later and ask how many tickets they've received in the last 6 months, and compare that to a random sample of people we meet walking down the street."

#19
- Class: text
  Output: "What might be a threat to internal validity in that study?"

#20
- Class: text
  Output: "A large one is selection. Those individuals who showed up self-selected into receiving our 'treatment'. "

#21
- Class: text
  Output: "They could have some trait that makes them different from the start - they cared enough about this to come and receive educational services."

#22
- Class: text
  Output: "Imagine our course goes horribly wrong, and thirty of our participants got put in jail. So, when we call, we get 30 missed calls, and 20 participants who stated they hadn't received a ticket since our lesson."

#23
- Class: text
  Output: "What is the threat to internal validity?"

#24
- Class: text
  Output: "This is called attrition. People drop out (for various reasons) from data collection. And so, we lose some valuable information. We hope that it's just random - we called, and randomly 30 people didn't answer. But, in this case, it was clear that the drop out had to do exactly with our treatment, and we would not be aware of this fact!"
