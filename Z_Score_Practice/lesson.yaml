  Output: "Hello! In this class we're going to walk through a few more examples of z scores."

- Class: text
  Output: "This would be a great class to re-take to review for your exams. There are four examples in this lesson."
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "What is the equation for calculating a z-score?"
  AnswerChoices: (Given Score - Mean) / Standard Deviation; Given Score - Mean / Standard Deviation; (Given Score - Mean) * Standard Deviation; (Given Score + Mean) / Standard Error
  CorrectAnswer: (Given Score - Mean) / Standard Deviation
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="(Given Score - Mean) / Standard Deviation")
  Hint: Check your parentheses! 

- Class: text
  Output: "Question 1. Let's imagine the CES-D scores (a clinical scale for depression) for a group of group of students is normally distributed with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5. \n\n What is the probability that a student selected at random has a CES-D score greater than 55?"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "From that information, calculate out the number of standard deviations away from the mean of 50 a score of 55 would be."
  CorrectAnswer: (55-50)/5
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='(55-50)/5')
  Hint: "We should be subtracting the score of interest from the mean, and dividing that end resulting number by the standard deviation."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Great! Now, look at your z-table. We will call one for you to look at by plot(ztable). Do that now."
  CorrectAnswer: plot(ztable)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot(ztable)')
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Okay! So, now, looking at your ztable, what is the probability you would fall above a 55?"
  AnswerChoices: 15.87 percent;40 percent;31.72 percent;1.6 percent;48.40 percent
  CorrectAnswer: 15.87 percent
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="15.87 percent")
  Hint: "Remember, we want to only consider to the RIGHT of some value."

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Now, if I told you that someone had instead scored a 45 - 5 points below the mean - which would be one standard deviation below the mean - what would the probability be that someone scored lower than that person?"
  AnswerChoices: 15.87 percent;40 percent;31.72 percent;1.6 percent;48.40 percent
  CorrectAnswer: 15.87 percent
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="15.87 percent")
  Hint: "Remember, we want to only consider to the LEFT of some value."

- Class: text
  Output: "Exactly. That was just to remind you that the normal curve is symmetrical. So, the distance between the mean and one standard deviation to the left is the same as the distance between the mean and one standard deviation to the right."

- Class: text
  Output: "Question 2. Suppose the amount of aid provided to all undergraduates is normally distributed with a mean of $23,230 and a standard deviation of $2,932.50. What percentage of undergraduates get between $23,000 and $25,875?"

- Class: text
  Output: "Notice how there were two points we're interested in. So we need to get two different z scores."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "First, let's deal with the lower value. $23,000. Remember, the mean is $23,230 and the SD is $2,932.50. Calculate the z-score for this value now."
  CorrectAnswer: (23000-23230)/2932.5
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='(23000-23230)/2932.5')
  Hint: "We should be subtracting the $23,000 from the mean (which is 23230), and dividing that end resulting number by the standard deviation."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Great! Now, look at your z-table. We will call one for you to look at by plot(ztable_q2p1). Do that now."
  CorrectAnswer: plot(ztable_q2p1)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot(ztable_q2p1)')
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Okay! So, now, looking at your ztable, what is the probability you would fall below $23,000?"
  AnswerChoices: 15.86 percent;40 percent;31.72 percent;8.0 percent;46.81 percent
  CorrectAnswer: 46.81 percent
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="46.81 percent")
  Hint: "Remember, we want to only consider to the LEFT of some value. That means the tail, and since it's -.078, we want to be conservative and round up to -.08."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now, let's deal with the higher value. $25,875. Remember, the mean is $23,230 and the SD is $2,932.50. Calculate the z-score for this value now."
  CorrectAnswer: (25875-23230)/2932.5
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='(25875-23230)/2932.5')
  Hint: "We should be subtracting the $25,875 from the mean, and dividing that end resulting number by the standard deviation."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Great! Now, look at your z-table. We will call one for you to look at by plot(ztable_q2p2). Do that now."
  CorrectAnswer: plot(ztable_q2p2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot(ztable_q2p2)')
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Okay! So, now, looking at your ztable, what is the probability you would fall above $25,875?"
  AnswerChoices: 18.41 percent;18.82 percent;36.82 percent;9.0 percent;46.81 percent
  CorrectAnswer: 18.41 percent
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="18.41 percent")
  Hint: "Remember, we want to only consider to the RIGHT of some value."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Good. Hopefully you've been keeping up on some note pads on the side. To visualize what we've done so far, I've plotted what we've discovered so far. Type discovery now."
  CorrectAnswer: discovery
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='discovery')

- Class: text
  Output: "First we calculated the black going from $23,000 to negative infinity. We found that 46.81% of students fall under this shading. \n\n Next we calculated above $25,875. We found that 18.41% of students fall under this shading. \n\n We know that everyone under this curve is represented - or that there is a full 100% of the students being described here."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "So, if we know that 46.81% of students fell below $23,000, and 18.41% fell above $25,875, then how many fell between $23,000 and $25,875? We want to take all of the students (100% of them) and subtract off what values? Calculate this value now."
  CorrectAnswer: 34.78
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=34.78)
  Hint: "100-(XX.XX+XX.XX) would give it to you if you filled in the X's with the numbers we need."

- Class: text
  Output: "Exactly! Almost 35% of students fall into that amount of aid. "

- Class: text
  Output: "Second to last question. A researcher wants to know how political orientation impacts perceptions of immigrants. But, she wants to generalize her findings only to people with 'relatively average' political orientations, not those with extreme leanings. She measures each participant's political orientations on a large scale and gets a normal distribution with a mean of 59 and a standard deviation of 5. If she decides to exclude those higher than 69 and lower than 49 on the scale, what percent of her sample is she excluding?"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "First, let's deal with the lower value. 49. Remember, the mean is 59 and the SD is 5. Calculate the z-score for this value now."
  CorrectAnswer: (49-59)/5
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='(49-59)/5')
  Hint: "We should be subtracting the 49 fom the mean, and dividing that end resulting number by the standard deviation."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Good! And while we're at it, let's calculate the upper z score. The upper value was 69. The mean was 59 and the SD is 5. Calculate the z-score for this value now."
  CorrectAnswer: (69-59)/5
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='(69-59)/5')
  Hint: "We should be subtracting the 69 fom the mean, and dividing that end resulting number by the standard deviation."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Great! Now, look at your z-table. We will call one for you to look at by plot(ztable_q3). Do that now. You might need to click 'Zoom' in the bottom right window to get a better look."
  CorrectAnswer: plot(ztable_q3)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot(ztable_q3)')

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "What percentage of individuals would be removed if she removed individuals who scored higher than a 69?"
  AnswerChoices: 2.28 percent;2.05 percent;47.72 percent;2.33 percent;48.35 percent
  CorrectAnswer: 2.28 percent
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="2.28 percent")
  Hint: "It should be very small, and we're looking for percent in the tail!"
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "What percentage of individuals would be removed if she removed individuals who scored lower than a 49?"
  AnswerChoices: 2.28 percent;2.05 percent;47.72 percent;2.33 percent;48.35 percent
  CorrectAnswer: 2.28 percent
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="2.28 percent")
  Hint: "It should be very small, and we're looking for percent in the tail!"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Based on this, what percent of individuals in total would she exclude if she were to do this? Do the math now."
  CorrectAnswer: 4.56
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="4.56")
  Hint: "Just write the number. We know both tails, so if we want to remove both tails (figure out how much we excluded together) we should ADD both ends up."

- Class: text
  Output: "Your job has developed a test to determine whether or not salespeople should be promoted to senior positions. The test is normally distributed and has a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 7. Any salesperson scoring below the 80th percentile cannot be promoted. What is the cutoff score for promoting salespersons?"

- Class: text
  Output: "This one is a little tricky. Consider what we know. We know there's a cut off at 80% - that is to say, at some value of z, there are 80% below this value and 20% of people ABOVE this value."

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Where would we want to look on our z table?"
  AnswerChoices: Where % in mean to z is equal to 80;Where % in mean to z is equal to 20;Where z equals 20; Where z equals 80; Where z equals .20; Where % in upper tail equals 80;Where % in upper tail equals 20
  CorrectAnswer: Where % in upper tail equals 20
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Where % in upper tail equals 20")
  Hint: "Remember, we want to see the cutoff where 20% of people are better than this score."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Plot the z-table I've pulled up by typing plot(ztable_q4)"
  CorrectAnswer: plot(ztable_q4)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="plot(ztable_q4)")

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "What is the z score that corresponds most conservatively with 20% of the people better than this score?"
  AnswerChoices: 0.80;0.81;0.82;0.83;0.84;0.85;0.86
  CorrectAnswer: 0.85
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="0.85")
  Hint: "To be conservative means to be strict. At 0.85 we get 20.05%! That's more than we're looking for. At 0.86 we get 19.77%. That's a tougher line, so we'll always go with that one. "

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Reminder! What is the equation for calculating a z-score? (Yes, we've already asked this, do you remember?)"
  AnswerChoices: (Given Score - Mean) / Standard Deviation; Given Score - Mean / Standard Deviation; (Given Score - Mean) * Standard Deviation; (Given Score + Mean) / Standard Error
  CorrectAnswer: (Given Score - Mean) / Standard Deviation
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="(Given Score - Mean) / Standard Deviation")
  Hint: Check your parentheses! 

- Class: text
  Output: "Now, what do we know? We know our z score is equal to 0.85. We know our mean was 50. We know our standard deviation was 7. All we don't know is our given score that we need. "

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "We can flip the equation of a z score. If (x-50)/7 = 0.85, then multiply both sides by 7 and we get (x-50) = 5.95. \n\n Now, do the last part of this alegbra and find out what x is equal to."
  CorrectAnswer: 55.95
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=55.95)
  Hint: Add 50 to both sides!

- Class: text
  Output: "Exactly. Any salesperson who scores below a 55.95 would not be promoted."
