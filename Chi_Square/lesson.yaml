- Class: text
  Output: "Chi-Square tests are used to examine proportions. For example, how do we test if a dice is a fair, balanced dice?"

- Class: text
  Output: "Before we dive into the chi-square test, let's make sure we understand its assumptions. The chi-square test requires that- \n\n 1. The data must be categorical (ordinal or nominal). \n\n 2. The observations should be independent. \n\n 3. The sample should be large enough, with an expected frequency of at least 5 in each cell of the contingency table."

- Class: text
  Output: We'll practice the Chi-Square Test of Independence on a published study.
  
- Class: text
  Output: "The study aimed to examine dishonesty in a controlled setting. Researchers used a matrix task in which participants had to find two numbers that sum to 10 within matrices under time pressure. Afterward, participants reported how many matrices they solved correctly, providing an opportunity to cheat by exaggerating their performance for a larger reward."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "The study had two conditions- check and regular. In the check condition, after the participants completed the task, the correct solutions were projected on a screen, and participants were asked to compare their responses and count how many they had found. In the regular condition, participants were given ample time to count how many matrices they solved correctly, but no additional information was provided. Participants in both conditions had an equal opportunity to cheat by overclaiming the amount of matrices they had solved correctly."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's check the data by calling CheatData and piping it into the head() function.
  CorrectAnswer: CheatData |> head()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='CheatData |> head()')
  Hint: Try CheatData |> head()

- Class: text
  Output: "repCor (reported) represents the number of matrices that participants claimed to have solved correctly, as reported by them on their answer sheet. cirCor (correct) represents the number of matrices that were actually solved correctly, based on the evaluation of the participants' work sheets by researchers. These variables are used to assess the prevalence of overreporting (i.e., when participants claim to have solved more matrices correctly than they actually did), which might indicate dishonesty."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's see how many times participants lied based on their condition. Take your data, and then using the pipe function, select() the variables repCor and condition, and then pipe those two variables into table().
  CorrectAnswer: CheatData |> select(repCor,condition) |> table()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='CheatData |> select(repCor,condition) |> table()')
  Hint: Try CheatData |> select(repCor,condition) |> table()
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Great job. Now, hit the up arrow on your keyboard to bring back up that last function you wrote. Now, at the end of that, pipe in one more piece, mosaicplot(), with a single argument, color=c("gold", "darkred")
  CorrectAnswer: CheatData |> select(repCor,condition) |> table() |> mosaicplot(color=c("gold", "darkred"))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='CheatData |> select(repCor,condition) |> table() |> mosaicplot(color=c("gold", "darkred"))')
  Hint: Try CheatData |> select(repCor,condition) |> table() |> mosaicplot(color=c("gold", "darkred"))

- Class: text
  Output: "The size of each section would represent the frequency of each combination of repCor and condition. Based on the provided data, the sections would be as follows- The mosaic plot would show that in the check condition, a larger proportion of participants told the truth compared to the regular condition. Conversely, in the regular condition, there is a higher proportion of participants who overreported compared to the check condition."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can clean up the mosaic plot by adding a few more arguments into it. Why don't you add in a comma after darkred") and then add xlab = "Truthiness", ylab = "Condition",  main = "My Mosaic").
  CorrectAnswer: CheatData |> select(repCor,condition) |> table() |> mosaicplot(color=c("gold", "darkred"), xlab="Truthiness", ylab="Condition", main = "My Mosaic")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr=' CheatData |> select(repCor,condition) |> table() |> mosaicplot(color=c("gold", "darkred"), xlab="Truthiness", ylab="Condition", main = "My Mosaic")')
  Hint: Try CheatData |> select(repCor,condition) |> table() |> mosaicplot(color=c("gold", "darkred"), xlab="Truthiness", ylab="Condition", main = "My Mosaic")
  
- Class: text
  Output: But was this significant?
  
- Class: text
  Output: The authors write- "In the regular condition, 40.00% of the participants overreported  (i.e., percentage of participants whose Nreported was greater than theirNcorrect),  ... In the check condition, this figure dropped to 16.10% (χ2(1, n = 233) = 16.54, p < .001, Cohen’s w = .27. "

- Class: text
  Output: Let's take this sentence bit by bit. First, let's tackle (χ2(1, n = 233) = 16.54, p < .001, - the chi square test itself.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Hit the up arrow until you get to your CheatData |> select() |> table() call. From there, we want to pipe one more thing - chisq_test() from the rstatix package (which has been loaded for you). Include correct=FALSE in the call to chisq_test().
  CorrectAnswer: CheatData |> select(repCor,condition) |> table() |> chisq_test(correct=FALSE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='CheatData |> select(repCor,condition) |> table() |> chisq_test(, correct=FALSE)')
  Hint: Try CheatData |> select(repCor,condition) |> table() |> chisq_test(correct=FALSE).
  
- Class: text
  Output: Nailed it! Next, they describe things a little bit prior to giving that information. In the regular condition, 40.00% of the participants overreported  (i.e., percentage of participants whose Nreported was greater than theirNcorrect),  ... In the check condition, this figure dropped to 16.10%. \n\n

- Class: figure
  Output: The thing is - there is no 40%! How did they get that? Have you figured it out?
  Figure: Table1.R

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Hit the up arrow until you get to your CheatData |> select() |> table() |> chisq_test()  call. From there, we want to pipe one more thing - chisq_descriptives().
  CorrectAnswer: CheatData |> select(repCor,condition) |> table() |> chisq_test(correct=FALSE) |> chisq_descriptives()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='CheatData |> select(repCor,condition) |> table() |> chisq_test(, correct=FALSE) |> chisq_descriptives()')
  Hint: Try CheatData |> select(repCor,condition) |> table() |> chisq_test(correct=FALSE) |> chisq_descriptives()
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Where is the 40%?"
  AnswerChoices: In the row.prop column, fourth row; In the col.prop column, third row; In the std.resid column, all rows; In the prop column, second row.
  CorrectAnswer: In the col.prop column, third row
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='In the col.prop column, third row')
  Hint: Look for .40!
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Exactly. 40% of people within that single column lied (46/(46+69))=.40."

- Class: figure
  Output: The expected column is also part of how we calculate the chi square statistic in the first place. The equation for chi square is here, where we just sum the squared difference of the observed value minus the expected value, all divided by the expected. Expected values are calculated as the product of the total row and column N divided by the total N. If you are curious, go back to the last figure, scroll up, and use play() to take some time to solve for some of the expected.

- Class: text
  Output: "The last piece was the following -  (χ2(1, n = 233) = 16.54, p < .001, Cohen’s w = .27 where they mention Cohen's w. Just like Cohen's d, Cohen's w is a measure of effect size."
  
- Class: figure
  Output: Cohen's w, or omega, can be pretty easily calculated by hand if it is a 2x2 table, since it is simply the square root of the ratio of the chi squared value and the total N.
  Figure: omega.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: exact_question
  Output: Given a chi square statistic of 16.54, and an N of 233, and remembering sqrt() is our function for square root, what is the effect size? 
  CorrectAnswer: sqrt(16.54/233)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = sqrt(16.54/233))
  Hint: Try dividing and using the sqrt() function.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: There is also a function in the rcompanion library called cohenW(). If we pass in our contigency table (remember, take our data, and then select repCor and condition, and then use the table() function) and then call cohenW(), let's see what we get.
  CorrectAnswer: CheatData |> select(repCor,condition) |> table() |> cohenW()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'CheatData |> select(repCor,condition) |> table() |> cohenW()')
  Hint: CheatData |> select(repCor,condition) |> table() |> cohenW()
  
- Class: text
  Output: "The researchers also wanted to investigate the relationship between the participants making mistakes on their work sheet and overreporting in the regular condition compared to the check condition. They were particularly interested in comparing the proportions of overreporting between these two conditions for those who made one or more mistakes. They write 'In contrast, participants who did make one or more mistakes on their work sheet, were much more likely to overreport in the regular condition compared to the check condition (i.e., 74.55% and 18.64%, respectively; χ2(1, n = 114) = 35.86, p < .001, Cohen’s w = .56)."
