- Class: text
  Output: A correlation matrix is a table showing correlation coefficients between variables. Each cell in the table shows the correlation between two variables. We can use the 'cor' function in R to compute the correlation matrix of a dataset.

- Class: text
  Output: "Before we compute the correlation matrix, let's remind ourselves of the assumptions for a Pearson's correlation: \n\n 1. Linearity: The relationship between the two variables should be linear. \n\n 2. Bivariate Normality: The two variables should be normally distributed.\n\n 3. Homoscedasticity: The variability in one variable should be the same at all levels of the other variable.\n\n 4. Independence: The pairs of variables should be independent of each other."

- Class: text
  Output: If these assumptions are violated, using Spearman's correlation might be more appropriate. Spearman's correlation does not require a linear relationship and is more robust against outliers. It measures the monotonic relationship between two variables, meaning it assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function.

- Class: text
  Output: You generally see correlation matrices as the first table in a results section. It is good to report to assist in meta-analyses. 

- Class: text
  Output: For example, we can look at a short report a student of one of ours got published.

  Output: The citation for this data is Marshall, M., & Carriere, K.R. (2023). To post or not to post- Companies supporting mental health relates to stronger consumer support. Current Psychology.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let us look at the first few rows of the first dataset, loaded into your environment as 'activism'. Please type-  activism |> head()
  CorrectAnswer: activism |> head()
  Hint: Use the head function to display the first few rows of the dataset.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="head(activism)")
  
- Class: text
  Output: As you can see, we've already selected only the continuous variables that would go into the correlation matrix. You may have to do this independently (see the Notes). 
  
  #10
- Class: text
  Output: The first variable, TOT, is a variable that represents how much people would be willing to interact with a shop. It was their dependent variable. Another variable, CARE, represented how much participants felt the shop cared about a given social issue. Each participant also reported their age and their measure of mental health, called the GHQ, or general health questionnaire.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, assuming our first dataset meets the assumptions of Pearson's correlation, let's compute the correlation matrix. We'll use two ways - first, the most straightforward is to pipe (|>) activism into cor().
  CorrectAnswer: activism |> cor()
  Hint: Use the cor function to compute the correlation matrix.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="activism |> cor()")

- Class: cmd_question 
  Output: While not used very often, you could also plot your correlation matrix using corrplot from the corrplot library. This will create a correlogram. There are many possible modifications - we'll leave it to you to work through the documentation. But, to see what it looks like, hit up on your keyboard to get to your last activism |> cor() argument, and pipe (|>) one additional function, corrplot(). 
  CorrectAnswer: activism |> cor() |> corrplot()
  Hint: Use the corrplot() function to visualize the correlation matrix. 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="activism |> cor() |> corrplot()")

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can get even more information if we pipe our continuous-variable-only dataset, activism, into the psych library's corr.test() function. Try that now.
  CorrectAnswer: activism |> corr.test()
  Hint: activism |> corr.test()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="activism |> corr.test()")

- Class: text
  Output: Great job. It prints out three things - first, the correlation matrix. Two, it will print out the N for each correlation (becoming a matrix if there are unequal N). And three, the p values. Notice the note at the bottom - probability values above the diagonal adjust for multiple comparisons, and we should always report those.

#15
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Adjusting for multiple tests, what is the p-value for the correlation between TOT and age?
  AnswerChoices: .72;.04;.73; .24; .80; .00; 1.00
  CorrectAnswer: .72
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='.72')
  Hint: Look at the top half of the correlation matrix. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: It also notes, "To see confidence intervals of the correlations, print with the short=FALSE option". Hit the up arrow, and add pipe, where we will add print(short=FALSE).
  CorrectAnswer: activism |> corr.test() |> print(short=FALSE)
  Hint: activism |> corr.test() |> print(short=FALSE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="activism |> corr.test() |> print(short=FALSE)")
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If you wanted strictly a single correlation between X and Y, we could use the cor.test() function to be cor.test(x= , y=) and use the dollar sign notation to pick out the variables in particular. For example, try cor.test(activism$TOT, activism$CARE). Importantly, this has a single r in cor.test, not the double r in psych::corr.test().
  CorrectAnswer: cor.test(activism$TOT, activism$CARE)
  Hint: cor.test(activism$TOT, activism$CARE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='cor.test(activism$TOT, activism$CARE)')
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Or we can use a pipe-friendly option in cor_test() in the rstatix package. Take your data, activism, and pipe it into select, where we will select TOT and CARE, and then pipe that into cor_test().
  CorrectAnswer: activism |> select(TOT, CARE) |> cor_test()
  Hint: activism |> select(TOT, CARE) |> cor_test()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='activism |> select(TOT, CARE) |> cor_test()')
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If your data fits a Spearman correlation, add the argument method="spearman" to many of these functions. Hit the up arrow until you get to your corr.test() function, and then add method="spearman" as an argument. 
  CorrectAnswer: activism |> corr.test(method="spearman")
  Hint: activism |> corr.test(method="spearman")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(any_of_exprs="activism |> corr.test(method='spearman')", 'activism |> corr.test(method="spearman") |> print(short=FALSE)')

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Adjusting for multiple tests, what is the p-value for the correlation between TOT and age?
  AnswerChoices: .14;.00;.05;.97;.01;.05
  CorrectAnswer: .14
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='.14')
  Hint: Look at the top half of the correlation matrix for p values.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Finally, we can also use the psych library to get Cronbach's Alpha of a scale. We loaded a second dataset from Sarah's paper, where we selected only the variables that made up the General Health Questionnaire, which she used as a control. The data is called ghq. Pipe it into names to view the question names.
  CorrectAnswer: ghq |> names()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ghq |> names()')
  Hint: Pipe ghq into names().

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can see how multiple questions make up the GHQ. We can pipe this into the alpha() function from the psych library. Try that now.
  CorrectAnswer: ghq |> alpha()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ghq |> alpha()')
  Hint: Pipe ghq into alpha()

- Class: text
  Output: There's a lot of output, but at the top, it shows that the raw_alpha is 0.89. That's all that is needed.

  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  CorrectAnswer: NULL
  AnswerTests: submit_log()
  Hint: hint
