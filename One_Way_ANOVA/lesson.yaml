#Note - need to review Type 1/ Type 2 error rates before this class. Did I?
#1
- Class: text
  Output: Hello! In this class, we will begin to explore some more advanced statistical methods.
#2
- Class: text
  Output: Currently, we've only done tests when there is two groups - A vs B. 
#3
- Class: text
  Output: However, we can easily imagine tests we would want to do with many groups. 
#4
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Imagine we wanted to test four different groups. How many t-tests would we need to preform to test the differences between all of the groups?
  AnswerChoices: 4;10;3;9;6;12
  CorrectAnswer: 6
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='6')
  Hint: Think of them like A, B, C, and D. We'd need to test A vs B, A vs C, A vs D, B vs C, B vs D, C vs D. How many is that?
#5
- Class: text
  Output: Exactly! 6 times! This is a huge problem. Every time we do a test, we increase our Type I Error Rate. 
#6
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is Type I Error?
  AnswerChoices: Null Hypothesis is True and We Accept The Null;Null Hypothesis is False and we Accept the Null;Null Hypothesis is True and we Reject the Null;Null Hypothesis is False and we Reject the Null
  CorrectAnswer: "Null Hypothesis is True and we Reject the Null"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Null Hypothesis is True and we Reject the Null')
  Hint: Type I Error is when we incorrectly assume there is a result when there is actually no significant difference.
#7
- Class: text
  Output: Right! Remember, in our t-test we use 95% confidence. Which means there is a 5% chance we are actually wrong! 
#8
- Class: text
  Output: The probability of at least one significant result can be defined as (1-Probability of no significant results).
#9
- Class: text
  Output: For a single test, we already have decided that our threshold for no significant results is 95%.
#10
- Class: text
  Output: So, Probabilty of finding 1 significant result when there isn't one is (1-(.95)^1 - or 5%. 
#11
- Class: text
  Output: But, if we had to do this multiple times, it would be (1-(.95 * .95 * .95 ...)), or, 1-(.95)^n, where n is how many times we try.
#12
- Class: text
  Output: So, if we had to do that six times, there's a (1-(1-.05)^6) = (1-(.95)^6) = 26% chance we are actually wrong! 
#13
- Class: text
  Output: So, what we're going to use instead is an ANOVA. An ANOVA test is able to test all these multiple tests for us using a single test! 
#14
- Class: text
  Output: The outputted value, instead of a z score, is called an F Statistic. The ANOVA will provide us a singular Omnibus F-statistic. 
#15
- Class: text
  Output: In short, it is going to test if there exists some variation between [one or more] of the groups. That is all it can tell us.
#16
- Class: text
  Output: Let us run our first One-Way ANOVA. I've loaded some data into your Environment, the iris dataset. We've used it before.
#17
- Class: text
  Output: There are three species of iris flowers in this dataset. The curator of the data, Edgar Anderson, also collected measurements of the sepal length and width, and petal length and width.
#18
- Class: text
  Output: You can find out more information about this data, if you'd like, by typing ?iris.
#19
- Class: text
  Output: Let us test to see if Petal Length differs by Species.
#20
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We will create a new variable, oneway, and store it as the result of the function aov(), which we will pass two arguments, data=iris, and Petal.Length~Species.
  CorrectAnswer: oneway <- aov(data=iris, Petal.Length~Species)
  AnswerTests: expr_creates_var('oneway'); omnitest(correctVal='aov(data=iris, Petal.Length~Species)')
  Hint: oneway <- aov(data=iris, Petal.Length~Species)
#21
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Fantastic. Now, we'll display the results. Do this by passing one argument, oneway, into the function summary().
  CorrectAnswer: summary(oneway)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='summary(oneway)')
#22
- Class: text
  Output: "We'll move column by column. We can see in the first column we have Species and Residuals. What this means is that Species has some explanatory effect on Petal.Length (because we're testing it) and anything that isn't explained by Species will go into Residuals. We also call Residuals Error, Within Subjects Error, or Between Subjects Error, depending."
#23
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "The second column says 2 and 147. There were 150 observations total (see Environment). 2+147=149. So, our df is N-1. But, we notice that Species is df = 2. In our t-tests, df was equal to 1. Why is this?"
  AnswerChoices: Because there are two different Species;Because there are three different Species;Because df has two letters;Because it is just magic.
  CorrectAnswer: Because there are three different Species
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Because there are three different Species')
#24
- Class: text
  Output: Exactly. The df for each variable is the number of groups (k) minus 1. Because we have 3 groups, 3-1=2. Then, the number of residual df is N (our total number of observations) minus k-1. 
#25
#SUM OF SQUARES 
- Class: text
  Output: The next column says Sum Sq 437.1 and  27.2. 
#26
- Class: text
  Output: The next column says Mean Sq 218.55 and 0.19. If we look to the left, what we've done is taken the Sum Sq number and divided by the df number. So, 437.1/2=218.55 and 27.2/147=0.19
#27
- Class: text
  Output: The next value is our F value. We take the Mean Sq Value and divide it by the Residuals Value. So, we see that 218.55/0.19 = 1150. 
#28
- Class: text
  Output: That F Value is our new type of P value. While we saw that our P value had a normal distribution, the F statistics fall on a different distribution, called the F distribution.
#29
- Class: text
  Output: There are some important things about our F distribution. For one, it cannot go below 0. It is also positively skewed, so we have many values at 1, and then it goes outward.
#30
#SHOW GRAPH?
- Class: text
  Output: Our final column said Pr(>F) <2e-16 ***. This is our p value. Again, we're using a 95% confidence level, or p < .05. 
#31
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "So, our one-way ANOVA showed that:"
  AnswerChoices: There was no significant difference between Species in Petal Length;There was at least one significant difference between Species in Petal Length;There was a significant difference between Setosa and Versicolor in Petal Length; There was a significant difference between Virginica, Versicolor, and Setosa in Petal Length.
  CorrectAnswer: There was at least one significant difference between Species in Petal Length
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='There was at least one significant difference between Species in Petal Length')
#32
- Class: text
  Output: Exactly. All our ANOVA told us was that we had permission to explore the differences between groups further - as it detected at least one significant difference.
#33
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Great! So, now we have to run post-hoc tests to determine where the differences lie. From the stats package, call the TukeyHSD() function, and pass one argument into it, oneway.
  CorrectAnswer: stats::TukeyHSD(oneway)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='stats::TukeyHSD(oneway)')
#34
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which pair is significantly different from each other?
  AnswerChoices: Versicolor-Setosa; Virginica-Setosa; Virginica-Versicolor; Virginica-Setosa & Virginica-Versicolor; All of them; None of them; Virginica-Setosa & Versicolor-Setosa; Versicolor-Setosa & Virginica-Versicolor
  CorrectAnswer: All of them
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='All of them')
  Hint: They all have p<.00001, which means...?
#35
# LOOK UP SCRIPT GENERATION FOR GGPLOT
