  Lesson: Two Way ANOVA [Between]

#1
- Class: text
  Output: In the last class, we reviewed a one-way ANOVA, where a single factor, or variable, with more than 2 levels, was tested.
#2
- Class: text
  Output: But, the world is not simply just one variable. There are many variables in the world. And, there are many variables that effect different people differently.
  #3
- Class: text
  Output: For example, we may have a drug. It could have two levels - either you're given the drug, or you're not. We also record your gender - either you are male, or you are female.
#4
- Class: text
  Output: In this case, we have four groups - males with the drug, males without the drug, females with the drug, females without the drug.
#5
- Class: text
  Output: ANOVAs can tell us many things. They can tell us then the effect of gender, the effect of the drug, and the effect of the drug depending on gender. 
#6 
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "So, today, we are going to analyze results from an actual paper, and run our first ANOVA on it. Researchers went to a train track, and recruited 100 participants standing on the Eastbound track and 100 standing on the Westbound track. They were randomly assigned to rate how far away they felt a stop was. The stop was either one or two stops ahead or behind them (So, either 1 stop ahead, 2 stops ahead, 1 stop behind, 2 stops behind). In reality, the stops are equally spread apart. The research question was this - do people subjectively feel that their destination is closer or further away than where they are coming from (behind them)? \n\nI've loaded their dataset, called data. Check the top six rows by calling head(data). \n\nTo see the full citation, see Maglio, S. J., & Polman, E. (2014). Spatial orientation shrinks and expands psychological distance. Psychological Science. 25(7). 1345-1352."
  CorrectAnswer: head(data)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='head(data)')
  Hint: head(data)
#7
- Class: text
  Output: "Great job! You can see that there is a variable called stationname. This is one of four station names the researchers asked participants about. \n\n The second variable is called directionf. We will see later it is either Traveling East or Traveling West. Finally, there is a rating of subjective distance."   
#8
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "This dataset includes two independent variables. One, stationname, has four different stations. The other, directionf, has two different directions. Participants could only be a part of one condition. If we were discussing the kind of ANOVA we would be running, we'd say it was a:"
  AnswerChoices: 2x2 Between Subjects ANOVA;2x2x2x2 ANOVA;2x4 Between Subjects Design;2x4 Within Subjects Design;2x4 Mixed Design
  CorrectAnswer: "2x4 Between Subjects Design"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='2x4 Between Subjects Design')
#9
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Great. What were they measuring - as in, what was their outcome of interest - what was their dependent variable?"
  AnswerChoices: Direction Facing; Station Name; Participant Number; Subjective Distance Away
  CorrectAnswer: "Subjective Distance Away"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Subjective Distance Away')
#10
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Great! Now let's run our ANOVA. We're going to use the function aov(), which we'll pass this other function, lm(). Inside of lm(), it will take two arguments. The first, data=, needs to correspond to our dataset, which we have called data. The second is an equation. The way we write equations in R is by dependentvariable ~ independentvariable*independentvariabletwo. We'll save this all under a new variable, results."
  CorrectAnswer: results <- aov(lm(data=data, subjective_distance~stationname*directionf))
  AnswerTests:  expr_creates_var('results'); omnitest(correctExpr='results <- aov(lm(data=data, subjective_distance~stationname*directionf))')
  Hint: "There are two factors - stationname and directionf. Did you remember to save it as a variable called results? Finally, because we're doing an ANOVA, we want to include the interaction. * means interaction, + means just an additional variable."
#11
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now let's see the results by using the summary() function, passing our ANOVA results, saved as results, to it."
  CorrectAnswer: summary(results)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(results)')
  Hint: summary(results)
#12
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which variable is not significantly different from each other?
  AnswerChoices: Station Name; Direction Facing; The Interaction Between Station Name and Direction Facing; Residuals
  CorrectAnswer: "Direction Facing"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Direction Facing')
#13
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What can we say about Station Name's significance?
  AnswerChoices: There is a different but we dont know where; All of them are different from each other; None of them are different
  CorrectAnswer: "There is a different but we dont know where"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='There is a different but we dont know where')
#14
- Class: text
  Output: "Exactly. So, we need to run something called post hoc tests. What this does is run t-tests between each of our different groups. Remember we have a 2x4 design, or eight possible conditions. So, there's A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. Consider that we would need to test A->B, A->C, A->D, A->E, A->F, A->G, and A->H. Then B->C (not B->A because we already tested that). All the way down! We can generalize this idea that for N groups, take N-1, and then add up each number from that on"
#15
- Class: text
  Output: "For example, in a study with 6 conditions, N=6 groups. N-1=5. So, 5+4+3+2+1=15. There are 15 different t.tests we can run if we had 6 groups! If you like formulas, it can also be written as k(k-1)/2 where k=number of groups."
#16
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "So, knowing this: Our study was a 4x2, or eight conditions. How many different t.tests can we run against 8 conditions?"
  AnswerChoices: 8;4;28;20;15 
  CorrectAnswer: "20"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="20")
#17
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Great. So, let's see those 20 t.tests appear. In class, we'll talk about adjusting our p-value. For now, run the TukeyHSD() function from the stats package, and in that function, pass our results into it."
  CorrectAnswer: stats::TukeyHSD(results)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='stats::TukeyHSD(results)')
#18
- Class: text
  Output: "There's a lot! Like we said. It might be best to visualize these results. For the rest of this class, we're going to build together a script that will summarize our results and plot them using ggplot2."
#19
- Class: script
  Output: "I just opened an R script for you. For this question, you will be editting a  function from plyr in the script. Your goal is to re-create the example output shown in the  comments of the script. When you are ready to submit your script, save the script and type 'submit()', or type 'reset()' to reset  the script to its original state."
  AnswerTests: script_results_identical('new_data')
  Hint: Order does matter here, so be sure directionf is the first factor you list.
  Script: ddply_step1.R
#20
- Class: script
  Output: "Great job. Now we need to create 3 more variables - the mean for each group,  the standard deviation for each group, and the standard error for each group. When you are ready to submit your script, save the script and type 'submit()', or type 'reset()' to reset  the script to its original state."

  Hint: SE can be calculated as SD/sqrt(N).
