- Class: text
  Output: In the last module, we talked about one sample t-test. This is when a sample's mean against a population's mean.

- Class: text
  Output: However, we want to test whether there are differences between groups.
  
- Class: text
  Output: For example, sometimes we give a drug to one group and don't give a drug to others. We want to see if the drug makes any difference in their lives. 

- Class: figure
  Output: This is the equation for the independent samples t-test.
  Figure: isttest.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: "We calculate this by taking the mean of group 1 (X1) and subtracting off the mean of group 2 (X2) and dividing that by the pooled standard error."

- Class: figure
  Output: "The pooled variance, or standard deviation squared, takes the degrees of freedom of each group and multiplies that by the variance. This permits a weighted variance average, where we will favor the group with higher sample sizes (if sample sizes are uneven)."
  Figure: pooledvariance.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: The assumptions of the independent samples t-test are as follows-

- Class: text
  Output: (1) Independence of observations. Each subject should only belong to one group. 

- Class: text
  Output: (2) Random samples. Both samples must be randomly sampled from the population.

- Class: text
  Output: (3) Normal distribution. The response variable is normally distributed between each population.
  
- Class: text
  Output: (4) Equivalence of variances. The standard deviation of the distribution is equal in both populations. 

- Class: text
  Output: We cover violations of (3) in the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test and violations of (4) in Welch's Two Sample T-Test. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: But for now, let us consider datasets that do not have violations of these assumptions.

#Explain the data
- Class: text
  Output: "Researchers wanted to test if there was a difference between vocal presentation of skills (giving a speech) and written presentation of skills (writing a speech) on how likely a job candidate was to be hired. Participants were randomly assigned to either listen to a recording of a job candidate's speech or read a paper copy of a job candidate's speech and then asked to rate the candidate on intellect (composed of an intelligence rating, a competence rating, and a thoughtfulness rating), overall impression, and the likelihood of hiring the candidate. "

- Class: text
  Output: "The citation for this study is Schroeder, J., & Epley, N. (2015). The Sound of Intellect: Speech Reveals a Thoughtful Mind, Increasing a Job Candidate’s Appeal. Psychological Science, 26(6), 877–891. https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797615572906."
 
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's look at the data now by piping (|>) our dataset (df) into head(). 
  CorrectAnswer: df |> head()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='df |> head()')
  Hint: Try df |> head().

- Class: text
  Output: At one point, the authors write the following - "In particular, the recruiters believed that the job candidates had greater intellect—were more competent, thoughtful, and intelligent—when they listened to pitches (M = 5.63, SD = 1.61) than when they read pitches (M = 3.65, SD = 1.91), t(37) = 3.53, p < .01, 95% CI of the difference = [0.85, 3.13], d = 1.16]". 

- Class: text
  Output: Can we replicate that?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's run a t-test on the data, seeing if audio assists perceived intellect ratings. Take our data, df, and pipe it (|>) into the t.test() function. Pass that function three arguments, Intellect_Rating~Condition, data=_, and var.equal=TRUE .
  CorrectAnswer: df |> t.test(Intellect_Rating~Condition, data=_, var.equal=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='df |> t.test(Intellect_Rating~Condition, data=_, var.equal=TRUE)')
  Hint: df |> t.test(Intellect_Rating~Condition, data=_, var.equal=TRUE)

- Class: text
  Output: While the t-test output gives us our means, it doesn't provide standard deviations. While we've learned how to get the standard deviation of a single variable, we haven't talked about how to get the standard deviation of a single variable grouped by multiple levels. If you've taken GGPlots Grouped Bar Plots or Basic Tidyverse Verbs, you might know this already. Remember, they wrote- "when they listened to pitches (M = 5.63, SD = 1.61) than when they read pitches (M = 3.65, SD = 1.91)"

- Class: script
  Output: We've loaded a script to solve how to get group based standard deviations. Save your script before you type submit().
  AnswerTests: script_results_identical('sum_intellect')
  Hint: Follow the notes in the script, and be sure you saved your script (using the save button or ctrl+S) before typing submit() in the Console.
  Script: summarise.R

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Print out the results of your script in the console now by typing in sum_intellect. 
  CorrectAnswer: sum_intellect
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sum_intellect')
  Hint: Type sum_intellect. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: And finally, we can also get that effect size they report (95% CI of the difference = [0.85, 3.13], d = 1.16].)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To get their effect size, we need to use a new function, and we will pipe (|>) our data (df) into it.  In the lsr library, there is a function called cohensD(). It takes at least two inputs- the formula (Intellect_Rating ~ Condition) and the data (for us, because we are piping, remember data=_). Let's try just those two inputs now.
  CorrectAnswer: df |> cohensD(Intellect_Rating~Condition, data=_)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='df |> cohensD(Intellect_Rating~Condition, data=_)')
  Hint: df |> cohensD(Intellect_Rating~Condition, data=_)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Great job! Unfortunately, that's not what they reported. Their effect size was 1.16, and ours is 1.13. What can we do? Well, cohensD takes another argument, method. Let's set method = "raw". The help file (or typing cohensD( into your console) would show that the default value is method is "pooled" and try again. Remember, you can hit the up arrow on your keyboard to bring up your hard work.
  CorrectAnswer: df |> cohensD(Intellect_Rating~Condition, data=_, method="raw")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='df |> cohensD(Intellect_Rating~Condition, data=_, method="raw")')
  Hint: df |> cohensD(Intellect_Rating~Condition, data=_, method="raw")

- Class: text
  Output: We got it! So what's the difference? 
  
- Class: figure
  Output: It comes down to these two formulas to calculate effect size. The one on the left is method="pooled", while the one on the right is method="raw". The left one uses our pooled standard deviation equation we are used to, while the one on the right does not (notice the only difference is subtracting two from the denominator of the square root. While the left is an unbiased estimator of the population variance, it is not necessarily true that taking the square root of an unbiased estimator will necessarily lead to an unbiased estimator of the standard deviation. It is also worth acknowledging that the differences reported are relatively minor and decrease in size of the differences as N increases. Still, we will choose the most conservative method (i.e., provides the smallest effect size), which is always method="pooled" or not setting method equal to anything.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Scroll back through your commands using the up arrow, and let's re-enter the t.test() formula. As a reminder, or if you can't find it, take our data, df, and pipe it (|>) into the t.test() function. Pass that function three arguments, Intellect_Rating~Condition, data=_, and var.equal=TRUE .
  CorrectAnswer: df |> t.test(Intellect_Rating~Condition, data=_, var.equal=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='df |> t.test(Intellect_Rating~Condition, data=_, var.equal=TRUE)')
  Hint: df |> t.test(Intellect_Rating~Condition, data=_, var.equal=TRUE)

  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Yes')
  Hint: Is .001144 smaller or larger than .05?

  Hint: Type sum_hire
  
- Class: text
  Output: In another study, researchers wanted to test if there was a difference between frozen goals (goals you continually set but make no effort to achieve) and active goals (goals you set and make an effort to achieve). They randomly assigned people to think about frozen or active goals and asked them to rate the characteristics of these goals, including how important it was to achieve this goal, how difficult it was to achieve it, and how much progress they made on it. 

- Class: text
  Output: They write, "The purpose of this study was to compare the descriptive qualities of frozen goals to active goals. To analyze how frozen goals differed from active goals, we used a series of independent sample t-tests to compare characteristics. "
  
- Class: text
  Output: "The citation for this paper is Davydenko, M., Werner, K. M., & Milyavskaya, M. (2019). Frozen Goals- Identifying and Defining a New Type of Goal. Collabra: Psychology, 5(1), 17. doi.org/10.1525/collabra.194."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The data is loaded in your environment as goalsdf. Our first step when given data is to do what? Examine what it looks like via summary(), head(), tail(), or View(). Exactly. Do one of those now, remembering to pipe |> your dataframe into one of the functions.
  CorrectAnswer: goalsdf |> summary()
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('summary(goalsdf)', 'goalsdf |> summary()', 'head(goalsdf)', 'goalsdf |> head()', 'tail(goalsdf)', 'goalsdf |> tail()', 'View(goalsdf)', 'goalsdf |> View()')
  Hint: Generally, we've been using summary(). So, type goalsdf |> summary().
  
- Class: text
  Output: There are a few variables in this dataset. ID is the participant ID. They asked how important achieving the goal was to them (achieve.goal.importance), the progress they've made towards that goal (progress), how important to them it was to have that goal (have.goal.importance), and how difficult it would be to achieve that goal (difficult.achieve). Progress was from a 0-100 scale, while the rest ranged from 1-7.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Test one of these response variables. Be sure that your answer takes the data (goalsdf), pipe it (|>) into t.test(), where your equation should be your chosen response variable ~ the grouping explanatory variable, and then data=_ and var.equal=TRUE. 
  CorrectAnswer: goalsdf |> t.test(progress ~ condition, data=_, var.equal=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('goalsdf |> t.test(progress ~ condition, data=_, var.equal=TRUE)', 'goalsdf |> t.test(have.goal.importance ~ condition, data=_, var.equal=TRUE)', 'goalsdf |> t.test(achieve.goal.importance ~ condition, data=_, var.equal=TRUE)', 'goalsdf |> t.test(difficult.achieve ~ condition, data=_, var.equal=TRUE)')
  Hint: There are many, but for example, try goalsdf |> t.test(progress ~ condition, data=_, var.equal=TRUE)
