#1
- Class: text
  Output: In the last class, we talked about 1 sample t-tests. This is when tested a sample's mean against a population mean.

- Class: text
  Output: However, that's not really interesting. What we want to learn in Psychology is what are differences between groups.
  
- Class: text
  Output: For example, sometimes we give a drug to one group, and don't give a drug to others. We want to see if the drug makes any difference in their lives. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: This is called the Two Sample T-Test. We also can call it the Independent Samples T Test.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's load the ttest formula. Type plot.equation(twosamplettest) now.
  CorrectAnswer: plot.equation(twosamplettest)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot.equation(twosamplettest)')

- Class: text
  Output: This is called the Two Sample T-Test.
  
- Class: text
  Output: "It may look daunting, but really, it's just treating the two groups as separate. The top of the equation is the same - we're taking the differences between groups."

- Class: text
  Output: "The bottom is also similar to the 1 Sample T. But each group's N is done on its own."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's load the variance formula. Type plot.equation(variance) now.
  CorrectAnswer: plot.equation(variance)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot.equation(variance)')

#10
- Class: text
  Output: "S^2 is also similar. You can see (xi-x1)^2 just means that we'll take each individual value from the first group and subtract it from the first group's average, and square it. Then, we do the same for the second group (noted by j)."

#Explain the data
- Class: text
  Output: "Today, we're going to use real data from a published paper. These researchers tested to see if a hiring manager hearing the person's voice would be more or less likely to hire the person compared to if they just read their resumes.  \n\nTo read the paper, see: Schroeder, J., & Epley, N. 2015. The sound of intellect: Speech reveals a thoughtful mind increase a job candidates appeal. Psychological Science. 877-891."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's run a t-test on the data, seeing if audio assists hiring decision ratings. Use the function t.test(), pass it two arguments, data=data, and Hire_Rating~condition.
  CorrectAnswer: t.test(data=data, Hire_Rating~condition)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='t.test(data=data, Hire_Rating~condition)')
  Hint: Don't forget about capitals!

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on this test, what is the p value?
  AnswerChoices: 0.01208; -2.6399; 0.4241; -3.2265; 0.98792
  CorrectAnswer: 0.01208
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0.01208')
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on this test, is there enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the 95% confidence level?
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Yes')
  Hint: Is .01208 smaller or larger than .05?
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on this test, is there enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the 99% confidence level?
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: No
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='No')
  Hint: Is .01208 smaller or larger than .01?

- Class: text
  Output: Exactly. So, for the independent samples t-test, we had two groups, and we tested to see if they were different. This is like testing boys vs. girls. There are two groups, and you can only be in one of them.

- Class: text
  Output: However, there are other ways we can test people. For example, we could test your attention before and after giving some interesting stimuli. 

- Class: text
  Output: This is called a Paired-Sample T-Test. It is paired because it's the same sample at two time points. Remember a problem with research is that there could be differences between groups. We try to randomize group assignment to fix this, but we are never sure if our randomization worked. 

- Class: text
  Output: But, what is more the same than yourself? If we test you between time 1 and time 2, the only thing that changed was time! You are (hopefully) the same person. 

#20
- Class: text
  Output: "Paired Samples also have the benefit of reducing the amount of people we need to collect. If we wanted two groups of people (some take drug, some don't), we would need say, 30 people for each group for a total of 60. But, if we used Paired Samples (first we test you without the drug, then we test you with it), we only need 30 people!"

- Class: text
  Output: "However, there are problems we need to be aware of with Paired Samples, or Within-Subjects designs. One is practice effects. If we first test you on something, then give you some kind of treatment, and test you again, sometimes we can't be sure if it's the treatment that improved your score, or the fact you took the same test twice."

- Class: text
  Output: "It could also work the other way. You've already taken the test once, so you are tired of taking it and do worse the second time around. This is called fatigue effect."

- Class: text
  Output: "However, we'll talk more about these problems in class. For now, let's just look at a dataset and paper that used a Paired Samples T-Test."

- Class: text
  Output: "However, there are problems we need to be aware of with Paired Samples, or Within-Subjects designs. One is practice effects. If we first test you on something, then give you some kind of treatment, and test you again, sometimes we can't be sure if it's the treatment that improved your score, or the fact you took the same test twice."

- Class: text
  Output: "Today, we will be looking at another dataset. In this study (Study 3), individuals who had partners were asked to write about their day with their partner on Feb. 8th. Then, a week later, they were asked to write about their day on the 14th (Valentine's Day). The researchers classified as these days as extraordinary (Valentine's Day) and ordinary (February 8th). Both times they rated how curious they would be to read what they wrote at a later date. Three months later, half of participants read the extraordinary event, and half read the ordinary event. They again rated how curious they were to read what they wrote. \n\nFor the full citation, see Zhang, T., Kim, T., Brooks, A.W., Gino, F., & Norton, M. I. (2014).

- Class: text
  Output: "For this lesson, we'll make it a little more simple. We'll just group everything together and consider the question: Did people find their days more extraordinary the day they wrote about it, or three months later?"

- Class: text
  Output: "So, to make the experiment simpler, we can word it as such. Imagine I asked you to write about your day (it could be your birthday, the holidays, or a regular day). I ask you to immediately rate how extraordinary you find what you wrote. Three months later, I have you read what you wrote and rate again how extraordinary it is you felt."

- Class: text
  Output: "Here, the independent variable is time. There was Time 1 (immediately following the day) and Time 2 (three months later). As everyone experienced both Time 1 and Time 2, this is Within-Subjects design."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's look at what variables are included in this dataset. Run the function names() by passing through our dataset called data2.
  CorrectAnswer: names(data2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='names(data2)')
  Hint: Don't forget about capitals!

#30
- Class: text
  Output: "So, we can see this dataset is set up with the variables T1_Extraordinariness and T2_Extraordinariness."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's run our new t.test on this data, seeing if we find events more extraordinary as they get older in time. Use the function t.test(), pass it three arguments, data2$T1_Extraordinariness, data2$T2_Extraordinariness, and paired=TRUE.
  CorrectAnswer: t.test(data2$T2_Extraordinariness, data2$T1_Extraordinariness, paired=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='t.test(data2$T2_Extraordinariness, data2$T1_Extraordinariness, paired=TRUE)')
  Hint: Use ?t.test if you have questions. Also remember to be using data2$ !

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on this test, what is the t statistic?
  AnswerChoices: 4.177; 0.9554; 4.8079; 0.3983; 0.6769; 129
